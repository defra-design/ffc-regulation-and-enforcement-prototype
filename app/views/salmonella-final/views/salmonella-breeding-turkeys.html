  <h2 id="legal-requirements">Legal requirements</h2>

  <p>Test for salmonella if you keep 250 or more breeding turkeys at any time in 12 months.</p>
  
  <p>You must:</p>

  
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>register your hatchery if you incubate 1,000 eggs or more</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>tell us if you change the breed of birds you hatch</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>take samples on the day the poults arrive from the hatchery</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>take samples from poults (young birds) at 4 weeks and 2 weeks before they move to a laying unit</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>take samples from adult breeding flocks every 3 weeks</p>
    </li>
    <li><p>take 2 sets of samples if you keep 50,000 birds or more in a flock</p></li>
    <li>
      <p>get a vet or official to collect the samples if you export eggs or sell to businesses that export poults</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>keep salmonella test results, hen movement and medicine records for at least 2 years</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>allow APHA or DAERA (in Northern Ireland) to take official samples</p>
    </li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>If a flock tests positive for a non-vaccine strain of Salmonella Enteritidis or Salmonella Typhimurium, you must:</p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>keep the flock that tested positive and their eggs on the farm</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>slaughter the whole positive flock as soon you’re told to do this</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>arrange the destruction of all incubating eggs placed in the hatchery, since the infection was found in the flock</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>request a movement licence from APHA or DAERA, if you want to move any incubated eggs for heat treatment or disposal</p>
    </li>
  </ul>
  
  <h3 id="why-you-must-test">Why you must test</h3>
  
  <p>It is part of the national control programme (NCP) to control salmonella in poultry.</p>

  <h3 id="register-places-where-you-have-flocks-or-a-hatchery">Register places where you have flocks or a hatchery</h3>
  
  <p>You must <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/poultry-including-game-birds-registration-rules-and-forms">register each premises where you keep flocks of 50 birds or more</a>.</p>
  
  <p>In Northern Ireland you must <a href="https://www.daera-ni.gov.uk/publications/bird-registration-form">register all poultry on the Northern Ireland Poultry Register</a>. This includes single backyard hens. The only exception is if it is a pet that lives with the owner.</p>
  
  <p>You must register your hatchery if it can incubate 1,000 or more eggs. You must state which species of poultry will be hatched at your hatchery. If this changes you must tell the organisation you registered with.</p>
  
  <h3 id="ask-your-vet-or-laboratory-for-advice">Ask your vet or laboratory for advice</h3>
  
  <p>They can help you:</p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>find a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/salmonella-in-poultry-testing-laboratories-in-the-uk">UK approved laboratory</a> or <a rel="external" href="https://www.daera-ni.gov.uk/articles/salmonella">laboratories approved in Northern Ireland</a></p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>with sampling plans and training staff to take the samples correctly</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>get the sampling kit you need</p>
    </li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>You can make use of other training schemes like <a href="https://liontrainingpassport.co.uk/">Lion Training Passport</a>.</p>
  
  <h3 id="export-hatching-eggs-or-supply-a-hatchery-that-exports-poults-young-turkeys">Export hatching eggs or supply a hatchery that exports poults (young turkeys)</h3>
  
  <p>You must get a vet or official to collect the samples. They will decide on the sampling programme and train staff members to take the samples. To export, you must have NCP tests.</p>
  
  <h3 id="work-out-how-many-flocks-you-have-to-sample">Work out how many flocks you have to sample</h3>
  
  <p>You must sample each of your flocks.</p>
  
  <p>A flock is a group of birds that shares the same air space, shed or range.</p>
  
  <p>If you need help working out how many flocks you have, ask:</p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p><a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/animal-and-plant-health-agency/about/access-and-opening">Animal and Plant Health Agency (APHA)</a> if you’re in England, Scotland or Wales</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><a rel="external" href="https://www.daera-ni.gov.uk/contact">DAERA</a> if you’re in Northern Ireland</p>
    </li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>You need to decide how many flocks you keep, so you collect all the samples you must take. If your birds form one flock, they’ll all be treated as belonging to a positive flock if sampling gives a positive result. Your decision about whether you have one or more flocks could affect how official disease controls affect your business.</p>
  
  <h2 id="when-to-take-samples-from-your-rearing-flock-of-turkeys">When to take samples from your rearing flock of turkeys</h2>
  
  <p>You must take samples:</p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>on the day the poults hatch or arrive from a hatchery</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>when they are 4 weeks old</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>2 weeks before you move them to the breeding unit</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>every 3 weeks from adult flocks</p>
    </li>
  </ul>
  
  <h3 id="avoid-taking-samples-after-giving-antibiotics">Avoid taking samples after giving antibiotics</h3>
  
  <p>Avoid taking samples during or shortly after giving your turkeys antimicrobials (antibiotics) that affect salmonella. APHA or DAERA could consider your flock to be positive for salmonella if:</p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>inspectors see from the flock medicine book that you’ve given antibiotics that affect salmonella in the 14 days before NCP testing</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>the laboratory suspects that there may be disinfectant or antibiotics affecting your samples</p>
    </li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>To find out when you can sample after giving antibiotics, ask:</p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>the vet who prescribed them</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/animal-and-plant-health-agency/about/access-and-opening">APHA</a> if you farm in England, Scotland or Wales</p>

  <h3 id="collect-samples-the-day-the-poults-hatch-arrive-from-the-hatchery">Collect samples the day the poults hatch</h3>
  
  <p>You can choose a different method each time you have to take samples. You must use one of these options:</p>
  
  <ol class="steps">
  <li>
  <p><a href="#option-1-take-an-eggshell-sample">Take an eggshell sample</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>

  <li>
  <p><a href="#option-3-take-a-hatcher-fluff-and-dust-sample">Use fabric swabs</a>.</p>
  </li>
  </ol>
  <p>If there are more than 50,000 eggs from one flock in the hatchery, you must take 2 sets of samples for that flock.</p>
  
  <p>Make sure you include 80% of the eggs from the flock you’re sampling. To do this, you must collect samples from enough hatchers containing eggs produced by the flock to reach this proportion.</p>

  </ol>
  <h3 id="take-samples-from-adult-breeding-flocks">Take samples from your adult breeding flocks every 3 weeks</h3>
  
  <p>Once you’ve moved the birds into the breeding unit, you must either:</p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>take samples from them on your premises</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>take samples of their eggs in the hatchery</p>
    </li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>You must take samples on the premises from breeding turkeys that lay hatching eggs that you sell to farms in other EU member states.</p>
  
  <p>You must take samples every 3 weeks. If officials collect samples during this period, you do not need to test again until 3 weeks later.</p>
  
  <p>If you’re sending breeding birds to slaughter for human consumption, you must collect samples and get the result in time to send it with them to slaughter. This means for birds that will be slaughtered at:</p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>up to 100 days old, you must collect samples in the 3 weeks before slaughter - unless they’re organic turkeys</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>more than 100 days old (or are younger but organic), you must collect samples in the 6 weeks before slaughter</p>
    </li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>If you farm organic turkeys, you must collect samples in the 6 weeks before slaughter. This only applies if your turkeys have organic certification from <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/organic-certification-list-of-uk-approved-organic-control-bodies">a UK approved organic controlled body</a></p>
  
  <p>You can take samples on your premises in the following ways as long as you meet the conditions for each type of sample. Make sure you follow the packaging instructions for the type of samples you take.</p>

  <h3 id="option-1-take-an-eggshell-sample">Option 1: take an eggshell sample</h3>
  
  <ol class="steps">
  <li>
  <p>Before sampling, check that the laboratory you plan to use can accept your liners. (Some laboratories will not be able to accept certain types of hatcher liners).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
  <p>Put on 2 new pairs of plastic gloves to make sure there is no contamination with disinfectant</p>
  </li>
  <li>
  <p>Take at least 10 grams (g) of broken eggshells from 25 hatcher baskets.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
  <p>Crush and mix them thoroughly in a strong plastic bag.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
  <p>Make sure that the bag and your gloves aren’t damaged to avoid any contamination that could lead to a false positive result.</p>
  </li>
  <li>

  </li>
  <li>
  <p>Choose at least one square metre (sq m) of hatcher basket liners from 5 hatcher baskets that have contained eggs from the flock you need to sample.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
  <p>Put the liners from different flocks into separate plastic bags to send to the laboratory.</p>
  </li>
  </ol>
  <p>You must send 10 poult box liners for each flock and  hatchery source with all the contents. The contents should include unhatched eggs, eggshells and all poults found dead or culled (killed) on arrival. This can be up to 60 carcasses from each hatchery.</p>

  <p>You should take special care to avoid contaminating the sample material if you keep other animals (especially pigs or cattle) on your premises.</p>
  
  <p>To prevent disinfectant or sanitiser affecting your sample, you should not use hand sanitiser on your plastic gloves.</p>
  
  <p>You should use:</p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>one or more swabs - the total surface area of the swab(s) must be at least 900sq cm</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>tap water or bottled still water for moistening swab(s) - do not use sparkling water or water treated with antibacterial agents or acids</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>disposable plastic gloves</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>leak-proof sealable bags or sample pots</p>

  <h2 id="what-to-do-with-the-samples">What to do with the samples</h2>
  
  <p>Find out what to include on labels and where to send your samples.</p>
  
  <h3 id="label-samples-correctly">Label samples correctly</h3>
  
  <p>On each label, you must include:</p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>the unique identifier of the flock</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>flock house name or number</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>month and year you moved the flock into that house</p>
    </li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>On the label or the laboratory’s submission form or system, provide:</p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>the type(s) of sample taken</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>date you took the sample</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>registration number, County Parish Holding (CPH) number, or DAERA flock number</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>name and address of the flock’s premises</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>age of the flock</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>number of birds in the flock</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>contact details of the person sending the sample</p>
    </li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>For hatchery samples, add the name of the hatchery and the hatcher machine number.</p>
  
  <h3 id="send-samples-to-a-uk-approved-laboratory">Send samples to a UK approved laboratory</h3>
  
  <p>You should send your samples on the day you collect them. Refrigerate your samples at 2 to 8°C if you cannot send them on the day of collection. You must not freeze samples.</p>
  
  <p>Check that the laboratory can start testing your samples within 4 days of sampling. You’ll need to send more samples if your samples are delayed, or the laboratory cannot meet the testing deadline.</p>
  
  <p>The laboratory will send your results to:</p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>the person who sent the sample or the registered owner of the sampled flock</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>APHA or DAERA - if the sample tests positive for salmonella (this may be called a Zoonoses Order or ZO2 notification by some laboratories)</p>
    </li>
  </ul>
  
  <h2 id="official-sampling">Official sampling</h2>
  
  <p>Officials will take a routine official sample in the lifetime of the flock. They’ll either visit your premises or collect the official sample at the hatchery you use.</p>
  
  <p>In England, Scotland and Wales, routine official samples may be taken by an:</p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>APHA official</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>authorised vet</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>auditor from the independent control body (if your flock is registered with the Red Tractor turkey assurance scheme)</p>
    </li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>In Northern Ireland, an official from DAERA will take routine official samples.</p>
  
  <p>For breeding flocks that are on the premises, officials will sample when the birds are aged between 30 to 45 weeks. Alternatively the official sample may be taken at hatchery. This sample will relate to eggs laid by the flock that are hatching. The sampled eggs must have been laid when the birds were aged between 30 to 45 weeks. The routine official sample (whether collected at premises or hatchery) can count as one of the operator samples you must take when your breeding turkeys are adult.</p>
  
  <p>You’ll be charged for these visits. An official sample can replace an operator sample. See <a href="https://www.gov.uk/salmonella-national-control-programmes-fees">official sampling fees for England, Scotland and Wales</a>. Contact <a rel="external" href="https://www.daera-ni.gov.uk/">DAERA</a> for details of fees in Northern Ireland.</p>
  
  <p>Officials from APHA or DAERA can also visit to take samples:</p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>if Salmonella Enteritidis or Salmonella Typhimurium has been detected in another flock or in a previous crop of flocks on your premises</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>from all the flocks on your premises if a positive test for Salmonella Enteritidis or Salmonella Typhimurium at the hatchery you use has been traced to one of your flocks</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>from flocks where there’s no evidence of testing</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>in cases where the competent authority (APHA or DAERA) considers it appropriate</p>
    </li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>Salmonella Enteritidis and Salmonella Typhimurium are the 2 salmonella strains covered by the turkey NCP. They are also known as regulated serotypes or serovars.</p>
  
  <h2 id="if-your-samples-test-positive-for-regulated-strains-of-salmonella">If your samples test positive for regulated strains of salmonella
  </h2>
  
  <p>You’ll need to take actions and apply restrictions to your flocks and premises.</p>
  
  <p>You’ll need to inform your vet of the positive result, if you have not made arrangements with the testing laboratory to do this automatically. </p>
  
  <p>If you suspect the result may have been due to an error (for example contamination of the original sample), you or your vet should contact APHA or DAERA. If APHA or DAERA agree, they’ll collect official confirmatory samples.</p>
  
  <h3 id="if-a-hatchery-sample-tests-positive">If a hatchery sample tests positive</h3>
  
  <p>APHA or DAERA will take samples when eggs hatched in a hatcher test positive for either:</p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>Salmonella Enteritidis</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Salmonella Typhimurium (including monophasic Salmonella Typhimurium)</p>
    </li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>They’ll take samples from the flocks on your premises that produced these eggs. The hatchery owner or an official may have collected the original positive hatcher sample.</p>
  
  <p>If APHA or DAERA confirm a non-vaccine strain of Salmonella Enteritidis or Salmonella Typhimurium in your flock, officials will contact you to tell you what you need to do.</p>
  
  <p>You must:</p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>keep the flock that tested positive and their eggs on the farm</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>slaughter the whole positive flock as soon you’re told to do this</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>arrange the destruction of all incubating eggs placed in the hatchery, since the infection was found in the flock</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>request a movement licence from APHA or DAERA, if you want to move any incubated eggs for heat treatment or disposal</p>
    </li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>APHA or DAERA may also place the hatchery under a movement restriction. The hatchery owner will need a licence to move equipment, animals, eggs or animal products to, or from their hatchery.</p>
  
  <p>Officials may also test for salmonella at the hatchery. APHA or DAERA will only lift the hatchery movement restrictions once sampling shows the hatchery is clean and disinfected.</p>
  
  <h3 id="if-a-sample-from-a-breeding-premises-tests-positive-for-a-regulated-salmonella">If a sample from a breeding premises tests positive for a regulated salmonella</h3>
  
  <p>APHA or DAERA will assess positive tests for non-vaccine strains of Salmonella Enteritidis or Salmonella Typhimurium (including monophasic Salmonella Typhimurium).</p>
  
  <p>If APHA or DAERA suspect the original result is a false positive, they’ll collect official confirmatory samples to confirm the presence of:</p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>Salmonella Enteritidis</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Salmonella Typhimurium (including monophasic Salmonella Typhimurium)</p>
    </li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>APHA or DAERA will also ask for 5 birds to be culled and will take their carcases and store their organs. They may use these to test for the presence of antibiotics if the confirmatory test is negative.</p>
  
  <p>APHA or DAERA will contact you to tell you what you have to do. You must:</p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>keep the birds and eggs from the positive flock(s) on your farm</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>have your positive flock or flocks slaughtered</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>make sure you arrange the destruction of all incubating eggs placed in the hatchery since the infection was found in the flock</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>request a movement licence from APHA or DAERA, if you want to move any unincubated eggs for heat treatment and disposal</p>
    </li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>You will not have to pay for any samples or testing carried out by APHA or DAERA because of a positive test result.</p>
  
  <h3 id="official-samples-from-other-flocks-on-your-premises">Official samples from other flocks on your premises</h3>
  
  <p>Once APHA or DAERA identifies at least one flock as positive, their officials will:</p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>take samples from every other flock on your premises - free of charge</p>
    </li>
    <li>take samples when a new flock is placed in the house where the last flock had a positive test result - free of charge</li>
    <li>visit your premises to give advice on salmonella control</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h3 id="after-a-positive-result-for-a-regulated-salmonella">After a positive result for a regulated salmonella</h3>
  
  <p>You must take NCP samples every 3 weeks for the 12 month period after the identification of a positive result for either non-vaccine strains of:</p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>Salmonella Enteritidis</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Salmonella Typhimurium (including monophasic Salmonella Typhimurium).</p>
    </li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>The 12 month period starts from the date when the house where the positive flock lived was disinfected.</p>
  
  <h3 id="compensation">Compensation</h3>
  
  <p>When a government organisation requires your birds to be culled, it will pay compensation for them as long as you follow its instructions.</p>
  
  <p>Compensation only applies if your flock tests positive for Salmonella Enteritidis or Salmonella Typhimurium (including monophasic Salmonella Typhimurium).</p>
  
  <h2 id="keep-salmonella-test-movement-and-medicine-records-for-at-least-2-years">Keep salmonella test, movement and medicine records for at least 2 years</h2>
  
  <p>Officials may check your records at any time.</p>

  </ul>
  
  <h2 id="food-chain-information-fci-documents-for-abattoirs">Food chain information (FCI) documents for abattoirs</h2>
  
  <p>When you send your flock to an abattoir for slaughter for human consumption you must fill in a FCI declaration document.</p>
  
  <p>In the FCI document, you must declare the most recent NCP test result and the date the sample was collected. If it was a negative result, you must also declare any previous positive salmonella test results with the sample collection dates. This includes results not taken as part of the NCP programme.</p>
  
  <p>If you cull the birds on the farm and dispose of them as animal by-products, you do not need to provide FCI.</p>
  
  <p>If you sell your birds direct to customers, you should warn them if your flock has had a positive salmonella result. You need a <a>licence to slaughter birds on your farm</a>.</p>
