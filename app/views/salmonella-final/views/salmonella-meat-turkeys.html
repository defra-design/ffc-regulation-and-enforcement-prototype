  <h2 id="legal-requirements">Legal requirements</h2>

  <p>You must test for salmonella if you keep 500 or more fattening turkeys at any time in 12 months.</p>
  
  <p>You must:</p>

  
  <ul>
   
    <li>
      <p>take samples in the 3 weeks before you slaughter turkeys aged 100 days or less</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>take samples in the 6 weeks before you slaughter turkeys aged more than 100 days</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>take samples in the 6 weeks before you slaughter organic turkeys</p>
    </li>
    <li>include the test results and date of sample in the food chain information (FCI) documents that go with flocks to slaughter</li>
    <li>
      <p>keep salmonella test results, hen movement and medicine records for at least 2 years</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>allow APHA or DAERA (in Northern Ireland) to take official samples</p>
    </li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>If a flock tests positive for a non-vaccine strain of Salmonella Enteritidis or Salmonella Typhimurium, you must:</p>
  
  <ul>
    
    <li>
      <p>clean and disinfect the shed after the flock goes for slaughter</p>
    </li>
    <li>allow APHA or DAERA to take samples from other flocks on your premises</li>
    <li>let APHA or DAERA take samples from the next flock to live in the restricted shed</li>
    <li>follow any movement restrictions</li>
    
  </ul>
  
  <h3 id="why-you-must-test">Why you must test</h3>
  
  <p>It is part of the national control programme (NCP) to control salmonella in poultry. You are breaking the law and may be prosecuted if you do not follow the rules.</p>

  <h3 id="get-an-exemption-from-testing">Get an exemption from testing</h3>

  <p>APHA can grant exemptions to farms in England, Scotland and Northern Ireland. </p>
  <p>You can apply for an exemption if both:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>you farm between 500 and 10,000 turkeys in a 12 month period</li>
    <li>you only sell them locally</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Sell locally means you sell direct to consumers at farmers' markets or to local retailers in:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>the county where you have premises</li>
    <li>the counties next to the one where you have premises</li>
    <li>anywhere up to 30 miles from the borders of the county where you have premises</li>
  </ul>
  <p></p>
  <p>Selling locally rules do not apply to sales of birds during the 2 weeks before Easter and Christmas.</p>

  <h3 id="register-places-where-you-have-flocks-or-a-hatchery">Register places where you have flocks or a hatchery</h3>
  
  <p>You must <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/poultry-including-game-birds-registration-rules-and-forms">register each premises where you keep flocks of 50 birds or more</a>.</p>
  
  <p>In Northern Ireland you must <a href="https://www.daera-ni.gov.uk/publications/bird-registration-form">register all poultry on the Northern Ireland Poultry Register</a>. This includes single backyard hens. The only exception is if it is a pet that lives with the owner.</p>
  
  <p>You must register your hatchery if it can incubate 1,000 or more eggs. You must state which species of poultry will be hatched at your hatchery. If this changes you must tell the organisation you registered with.</p>
  
  <h3 id="ask-your-vet-or-laboratory-for-advice">Ask your vet or laboratory for advice</h3>
  
  <p>They can help you:</p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>find a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/salmonella-in-poultry-testing-laboratories-in-the-uk">UK approved laboratory</a> or <a rel="external" href="https://www.daera-ni.gov.uk/articles/salmonella">laboratories approved in Northern Ireland</a></p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>with sampling plans and training staff to take the samples correctly</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>get the sampling kit you need</p>
    </li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>You can make use of other training schemes like <a href="https://liontrainingpassport.co.uk/">Lion Training Passport</a>.</p>
  
 
  <h3 id="work-out-how-many-flocks-you-have-to-sample">Work out how many flocks you have to sample</h3>
  
  <p>You must sample each of your flocks.</p>
  
  <p>A flock is a group of birds that shares the same air space, shed or range.</p>
  
  <p>If you need help working out how many flocks you have, ask:</p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p><a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/animal-and-plant-health-agency/about/access-and-opening">Animal and Plant Health Agency (APHA)</a> if you are in England, Scotland or Wales</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><a rel="external" href="https://www.daera-ni.gov.uk/contact">DAERA</a> if you are in Northern Ireland</p>
    </li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>You need to decide how many flocks you keep, so you collect all the samples you must take. If your birds form one flock, they’ll all be treated as belonging to a positive flock if sampling gives a positive result. Your decision about whether you have one or more flocks could affect how official disease controls affect your business.</p>
  
  <h2 id="when-to-take-samples-from-your-rearing-flock-of-turkeys">When to take samples from your fattening turkeys</h2>
  
  <p>You must take samples and get the results in time to send them with the flock to slaughter. For birds slaughtered at:</p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>100 days old or less, you must take samples in the 3 weeks before slaughter </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>more than 100 days old, you must take samples in the 6 weeks before slaughter</p>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>If you farm organic turkeys, you must collect samples in the 6 weeks before slaughter. This only applies if your turkeys have organic certification from a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/organic-certification-list-of-uk-approved-organic-control-bodies">UK approved organic control body</a>.</p>

  <h3 id="avoid-taking-samples-after-giving-antibiotics">Avoid taking samples after giving antibiotics</h3>
  
  <p>Avoid taking samples during or shortly after giving your turkeys antimicrobials (antibiotics) that affect salmonella. APHA or DAERA could consider your flock to be positive for salmonella if:</p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>inspectors see from the flock medicine book that you’ve given antibiotics that affect salmonella in the 14 days before NCP testing</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>the laboratory suspects that there may be disinfectant or antibiotics in your samples</p>
    </li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>To find out when you can sample after giving antibiotics, ask:</p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>the vet who prescribed them</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/animal-and-plant-health-agency/about/access-and-opening">APHA</a> if you farm in England, Scotland or Wales</p>

  </ul>

  <h2 id="choose-a-sampling-method">Choose a sampling method</h2>
  
  <p>You can take samples on your premises in one of these ways:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Method 1: take 2 pairs of boot swabs from each flock</li>
    <li>Method 2: take one pair of boot swabs and one 100g dust sample</li>
    <li>Method 3: take one or more hand-held faecal swabs with a total surface area of 900 square centimetres (sq cm) (only use this method if you cannot use boot swabs because the houses are too small and have fewer than 100 turkeys at the time of sampling.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Package each sample separately.</p>
  
  <h2 id="how-to-take-boot-swab-dust-samples">How to take boot swab, dust swab or hand-held samples</h2>
  
  <p>Follow these instructions to make sure your approved laboratory accepts your samples and you comply with the NCP.</p>

  <h3 id="prepare-to-take-samples-1">Prepare to take samples</h3>
  
  <p>Gather all the equipment you’re going to need before you go into the turkey house to prevent contamination before, during and after sampling. You should take special care to avoid cross-contaminating the sample material if you keep other animals (especially pigs or cattle) on your premises.</p>
  
  <h3 id="how-to-take-a-boot-swab">How to take a boot swab</h3>
  
  <p>Take samples from the existing bedding (litter). Do not put new bedding down before sampling.</p>
  
  <p>You will need:</p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>disposable plastic overboots</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>2 pairs of boot swabs - these must be absorbent enough to soak up moisture - you can also use tubegauze ‘socks’ or pre-moistened commercial swabs</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>tap water or bottled still water for moistening boot swabs - do not use sparkling water or water treated with antibacterial agents or acids</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>disposable plastic gloves</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>leak-proof sealable bags or sample pots</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>packaging for sending your sealable bags or sample pots to the laboratory</p>
    </li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>To prevent disinfectant or sanitiser affecting your sample, you should:</p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>not use hand sanitiser on your plastic gloves</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>put on your plastic overboots only after you have walked through any disinfectant boot dip</p>
    </li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>If you wear plastic overboots when you walk through disinfectant, you must put on another pair afterwards to protect the boot swabs from the disinfectant.</p>

  <h3 id="take-a-boot-swab-sample">Take a boot swab sample</h3>
  
  <ol class="steps">
  <li>
  <p>You should only sample inside the house.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
  <p>Avoid sampling the areas just inside of doors and pop holes, as they may have been contaminated by material from outside.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
  <p>Moisten the boot swabs with water before you take samples by pouring water inside them or shaking them in a container of water.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
  <p>You can either collect boot swabs (option 1) or a mixture of boot swabs and dust samples (option 2). See instructions for each of these options.</p>
  </li>
  </ol>
  <h3 id="option-1-only-collect-boot-swabs-from-adult-birds">Method 1: only collect boot swabs </h3>
  
  <ol class="steps">
 <li>
  <p>Divide the house into 2 equal parts for sampling, and use one pair of pre-moistened boot swabs in each part.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
  <p>Take at least 100 steps in each pair of boot swabs, and swab each half of the house.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
  <p>Drag your feet on the floor as you’re walking, to pick up as much material as you can.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
  <p>If the house is divided into several pens, spend more time in the larger pens and less in the smaller pens - make sure every pen is included in the sampling.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
  <p>When you’ve finished sampling, take the boot swabs off and carefully turn them inside out, so that the faeces you’ve collected stay on them.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
  <p>Put the boot swabs in a sample pot or sealable bag.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
  <p>Label each container carefully, ready to send to the laboratory.</p>
  </li>
  </ol>
  <h3 id="option-2-collect-boot-swabs-and-dust-samples-from-adult-birds">Method 2: collect boot swabs and dust samples</p>
  
  <p>If you’re collecting a combination of boot swabs and dust samples, take one pair of boot swabs from each flock.</p>
  
  <ol class="steps">
  <li>
  <p>Moisten the boot swabs with water before you take samples - the water must be sterile and not contain any antibiotics (antimicrobials) or sanitisers.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
  <p>Take at least 100 steps in the boot swabs - walking round the entire house. Make sure every part of the house is sampled.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
  <p>Drag your feet on the floor as you are walking, to pick up as much material as possible.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
  <p>If the house is divided into several pens spend more time in the larger pens and less in the smaller pens. Make sure that every pen is sampled.</p>

  <li>
  <p>When you’ve finished sampling, take the boot swabs off and carefully turn them inside out so that the faeces you’ve collected stay on them.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
  <p>Put the pair of boot swabs together in one bag or container. The dust swabs you collect will go into a second container.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
  <p>Label the container carefully, ready to send to the laboratory.</p>
  </li>
  </ol>

  <h3 id="how-to-take-a-dust-samp">How to take a dust swab</h3>

  <p>You should choose one of these methods:  </p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>collect 100g of dust from multiple places in the house nad put it in a pot</li>
    <li>use one or more moistened fabric swabs with a total surface area of at least 900 sq cm</li>

  <p>On each label, you must include:</p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>the unique identifier of the flock</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>flock house name or number</p>

    </li>
  </ul>
   
  <h3 id="send-samples-to-a-uk-approved-laboratory">Send samples to a UK approved laboratory</h3>
  
  <p>You should send your samples on the day you collect them. Refrigerate your samples at 2 to 8°C if you cannot send them on the day of collection. You must not freeze samples.</p>
  
  <p>Check that the laboratory can start testing your samples within 4 days of sampling. You’ll need to send more samples if your samples are delayed, or the laboratory cannot meet the testing deadline.</p>
  
  <p>The laboratory will send your results to:</p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>the person who sent the sample or the registered owner of the sampled flock</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>APHA or DAERA - if the sample tests positive for salmonella (this may be called a Zoonoses Order or ZO2 notification by some laboratories)</p>
    </li>
  </ul>
  
  <h2 id="official-sampling">Official sampling</h2>
  
  <p>Officials will take a routine official sample in the lifetime of the flock. Each year, a single flock on 10% of fattening turkey holdings must be sampled. These flocks are selected at random. The same premises will not be selected again for at least 5 years.</p>
  
  <p>In England, Scotland and Wales, routine official samples may be taken by an:</p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>APHA official</p>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <p>auditor from the independent control body (if your flock is registered with the Red Tractor turkey assurance scheme)</p>
    </li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>In Northern Ireland, an official from DAERA will take routine official samples.</p>
  
  <p>You’ll be charged for these visits. An official sample can replace an operator sample. See <a href="https://www.gov.uk/salmonella-national-control-programmes-fees">official sampling fees for England, Scotland and Wales</a>. Contact <a rel="external" href="https://www.daera-ni.gov.uk/">DAERA</a> for details of fees in Northern Ireland.</p>
  
  <p>Officials from APHA or DAERA can also visit to take samples:</p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>if Salmonella Enteritidis or Salmonella Typhimurium has been detected in another flock or in a previous crop of flocks on your premises</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>from all the flocks on your premises if a positive test for Salmonella Enteritidis or Salmonella Typhimurium at the hatchery you use has been traced to one of your flocks</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>from flocks where there’s no evidence of testing</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>in cases where the competent authority (APHA or DAERA) considers it appropriate</p>
    </li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>Salmonella Enteritidis and Salmonella Typhimurium are the 2 salmonella strains covered by the turkey NCP. They are also known as regulated serotypes or serovars.</p>
  
  <h2 id="if-your-samples-test-positive-for-regulated-strains-of-salmonella">If your samples test positive for regulated strains of salmonella
  </h2>
  
  <p>When you send a flock to slaughter, you must include in the Food Chain Information (FCI) documents:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>the NCP salmonella test result, negative or positive</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>date the sample was taken from the flock</p>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>This is a legal requirement and the birds may not be slaughtered if this information is not provided.</p>
  
  <p>If you suspect the result may have been due to an error (for example contamination of the original sample), you or your vet should contact APHA or DAERA. If APHA or DAERA agree, they’ll collect official confirmatory samples.</p>
  
  <p>
    If your samples test positive for salmonella: </p>
  <ul>
    <li>APHA or DAERA will take samples from every other flock on your holding to check for Salmonella enteritidis and salmonella typhimurium</li>
    <li>you will have to clean and disinfect the positive shed after you've sent the flock to slaughter</li>
  </ul>

  <p>APHA or DAERA will also return to take samples from your next crop of birds. If these tests are positive for Salmonella Enteritidis or Salmonella Typhimurium, APHA or DAERA will place your holding under a movement restriction. This means that you will only be allowed to move certain elements, for example, equipment, animals or animal products on to or off your holding with a licence from APHA or DAERA. You will also have to clean and disinfect the restricted poultry sheds under their supervision each time you de-populate.</p>
  <p>Once you are under a movement restriction, you can only restock restricted sheds after tests come back negative. </p>
  <p>Speak to your vet for advice about how to control salmonella.</p>
  <p>You will not have to pay for any samples or testing carried out by APHA or DAERA because of a positive test result.</p>

  <h2 id="food-chain-information-fci-documents-for-abattoirs">Food chain information (FCI) documents for abattoirs</h2>
  
  <p>When you send your flock to an abattoir for slaughter for human consumption you must fill in a FCI declaration document.</p>
  
  <p>In the FCI document, you must declare the most recent NCP test result and the date the sample was collected. If it was a negative result, you must also declare any previous positive salmonella test results with the sample collection dates. This includes results not taken as part of the NCP programme.</p>
  
  <p>If you cull the birds on the farm and dispose of them as animal by-products, you do not need to provide FCI.</p>
  
  <p>If you sell your birds direct to customers, you should warn them if your flock has had a positive salmonella result. You need a <a>licence to slaughter birds on your farm</a>.</p>
