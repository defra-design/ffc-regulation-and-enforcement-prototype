        retailers)</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>your flock is already under official salmonella restrictions after a positive test (in this situation the flock
        is not part of the national control programme (NCP) as you cannot sell your eggs)</p>

  <h3 id="what-you-must-report-to-APHA">Tell APHA before laying hens arrive</h3>
  <p>
    You must tell <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/animal-and-plant-health-agency/about/access-and-opening#animal-health-and-welfare-services">APHA</a> or DAERA before a laying flock of 250 hens or more arrives at your holding.</p>

  
  
    <h2 id="before-you-test">Before you test for salmonella </h2>
  
    <h3 id="register-flock-premises">Register places where you keep flocks</h3>
    <p>
      You must <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/poultry-including-game-birds-registration-rules-and-forms">register all premises where you keep flocks of 50 birds or more</a>.</p>
  
      <p>In Scotland you must also register your laying flocks with the <a href="https://www.ruralpayments.org/publicsite/futures/topics/inspections/all-inspections/egg-and-poultry-inspections/">Scottish Government Poultry Unit</a> for egg marketing reasons.</p>
      <p>In Northern Ireland you must register all poultry flocks on the <a href="https://www.daera-ni.gov.uk/publications/bird-registration-form">Northern Ireland Poultry Register</a>. This includes single backyard hens. The only exception is if it is a pet bird that lives in the owner’s house.</p>

  
  
    <h3 id="ask-for-help">Ask your vet or laboratory for help</h3>
 
  <p>They can help you: </p>

  <ul>
      <li>
        <p>find an <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/defra-approved-laboratories-salmonella-poultry-health-animal-by-products-and-rabies">approved UK laboratory</a></p>
      </li>
      <li>
      <p>with sample plans and training staff to take the samples
        correctly</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>get the sampling kit you need
      </p>
    </li>
  </ul>
    
      <p>You can make use of other training schemes like <a href="https://www.liontrainingpassport.co.uk">Lion Training Passport</a>.</p>
      <p>Work out how many flocks you have to sample. A flock is a group of birds that shares the same shed or air space. You must take samples from all flocks at a premises. </p>
 
<h2 id="take-samples">Take samples to test for salmonella</h2>

  <h3 id="make-sure-you-do-not-collect-samples-after-giving-antibiotics">Avoid taking samples after
    giving antibiotics</h3>

<p>Avoid taking samples while, or shortly after, giving your laying hens antimicrobials (antibiotics) that affect
    salmonella. APHA or DAERA could consider your flock to be positive for salmonella if:</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        <p>inspectors see from the flock medicine book that you’ve given antibiotics that affect salmonella within
            14 days before NCP testing</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>the laboratory suspects that there may be disinfectant or antibiotics affecting your samples</p>
    </li>
</ul>

<p>To find out when you can sample after giving antibiotics, ask:</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        <p>the vet who prescribed them</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p><a>APHA</a> in England, Scotland and Wales</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p><a rel="external" href="https://www.daera-ni.gov.uk/contact">DAERA</a> in Northern Ireland</p>
    </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="prepare-to-take-samples">Prepare to take samples</h3>

<p>Gather all the equipment you’re going to need before you go into the laying house, to prevent contamination
    before, during and after sampling. Take care to avoid cross-contamination if you keep other animals (especially other poultry, pigs or
    cattle).</p>


  <h3 id="collect-samples-from-chicks-on-the-day-they-arrive-from-the-hatchery">Collect samples from chicks on the day
    they arrive from the hatchery</h3>

  <p>You should test:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>the liners (chick papers) from boxes used to deliver the chicks - one box for every 500 chicks from each
        delivery (up to 10 boxes)</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>any chicks that are dead on arrival (up to 60 from each hatchery)</p>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3 id="collect-samples-from-pullets-2-weeks-before-you-move-them-to-the-laying-unit">Collect samples from pullets 2
    weeks before you move them to the laying unit</h3>

  <p>You should test:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>2 pairs of <a href="#how-to-take-boot-swab-samples">boot swabs</a> (fabric overshoes) for your floor-reared
        birds</p>

  <h3 id="collect-samples-from-your-adult-egg-laying-hens-every-15-weeks-during-the-laying-period">Collect samples from
    your adult laying hens every 15 weeks during the laying period</h3>

  <p>If officials collect routine samples during the laying period, you do not need to test again for 15 weeks.</p>

  <p>You must start to take samples from adult laying hens in the layer unit or house when they’re 22 to 26 weeks
    old.</p>

  <p>For barn or free-range flocks, you should test:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>2 pairs of <a href="#how-to-take-boot-swab-samples">boot swabs</a> when not part of a multi-tier system</p>

  <h2 id="what-happens-if-your-samples-test-positive-for-salmonella">If your samples test positive for regulated strains of salmonella</h2>

  <p>Use this section to understand the actions and restrictions that could apply to your flocks and premises.
  </p>

  <p>APHA or DAERA will assess the positive tests for regulated strains of salmonella (these are non-vaccine strain Salmonella enteritidis or Salmonella typhimurium, including monophasic Salmonella typhimurium).</p>

  <p>You must not sell the eggs as Class A from a flock that has tested positive - you’ll be put under a legal restriction notice.</p>

  <p>Egg marketing inspectors will visit your premises to check that you are complying with the restrictions. </p>

  <p>If you wish to sell the eggs as Class B, you can if you mark them with either:</p>

  <ul class="govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>the official Class B mark (a circle with the letter B inside)</li>
    <li>a spray of food dye to leave a visible coloured mark at 5 millimetres in diameter</li>
  </ul>

  <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Additional testing for salmonella after identifying a regulated strain</h3>

  <p>Contact <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/animal-and-plant-health-agency/about/access-and-opening">APHA</a> or <a href="https://www.daera-ni.gov.uk/contact">DAERA</a> if you have evidence showing contamination of the original sample.</p>

  <p>In exceptional cases, APHA or DAERA may agree to additional tests to rule out a false positive result. They’ll only permit the additional tests when there is:</p>

  <ul class="govuk-list--bullet">
    
    <li>no evidence that a flock is linked to a human outbreak</li>
    <li>strong evidence that the original result may be false</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>These tests must be carried out within 4 weeks of the APHA or DAERA laboratory reporting the positive sample and at your own expense.</p>
    
  <p>APHA or DAERA will arrange for an inspector to supervise the collection, choosing one from the following sample options:</p>
    <ul class="govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>300 hen carcasses</li>
    <li>4,000 eggs</li>
    <li>2 dust samples and 5 boot swab samples from barn and free-range birds</li>
    <li>2 dust samples and 5 pooled faeces samples from caged birds</li>
  </ul>
    <p>Depending on the test results, APHA or DAERA will decide if and when to lift the restrictions on your flock.</p>
    
    <h3>Official samples from other flocks on your premises</h3>
    <p>Once APHA or DAERA identifies at least one flock as positive, their officials will take samples from every other flock on your premises.</p>
    
    <p>Officials will also visit and sample when a new flock is placed in the house where the last flock had a positive test result. They’ll take this official control sample when the birds are between 22 and 26 weeks old.</p>
    
    <p>A government vet will also visit your premises to give advice on salmonella control. In Northern Ireland contact DAERA or your private vet for advice.</p>
    
    <p>You will not have to pay for:</p>
      <ul class="govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>official sampling of other flocks on your premises</li>
    <li>testing the new flock following its move to the house which officials identified as positive</li>

      </ul>
    <h3>Positive results from a rearing flock</h3>
    <p>If a sample from your rearing flock tests positive for a regulated salmonella, officials may visit your farm to confirm the result and offer advice.</p>
    
    <h3>Get advice on controlling other salmonella infections</h3>
    <p>If your flock tests positive for other types of salmonella, you can get advice on how to control the infection from:</p>
    <ul class="govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>your vet</li>
    <li>APHA if you live in England, Scotland or Wales</li>
    <li>DAERA if you live in Northern Ireland</li>
    </ul>

  <h2 id="food-chain-information-fci-documents-for-abattoirs">Include salmonella test results in food chain information (FCI) documents for abattoirs</h2>

  <p>When you send your flock to an abattoir for slaughter for human consumption you must fill in a <a rel="external"
      href="https://www.food.gov.uk/business-guidance/food-chain-information">FCI declaration document</a>.</p>

  <p>In the FCI document, you must declare information such as:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>the most recent NCP test result</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>the date the sample was collected</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>other diagnoses</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>the use of medicines</p>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>If it was a negative NCP result, you must also declare any previous positive salmonella test results with the
    sample collection dates. This includes results from tests not taken as part of the NCP programme.</p>

  <p>You do not need to provide FCI if you cull the birds on the farm and:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>dispose of them as animal by-products</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>sell your birds direct to customers</p>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>If selling your birds to customers, you should register this with your local authority. If your flock tests
    positive for salmonella, they will advise you on what you need to do to protect the health of your customers.</p>

  <p>You’ll need a <a>slaughterer’s licence</a> or employ a licenced slaughterer to slaughter birds on your farm.</p>

  <h2 id="get-advice">Get advice</h2>

  <p>If you need more advice, contact <a
