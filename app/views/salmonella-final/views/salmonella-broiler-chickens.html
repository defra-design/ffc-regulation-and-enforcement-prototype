  <h2 id="legal-requirements">Legal requirements</h2>
  
  <p>You must test for salmonella if you keep 2,000 or more broiler chickens at any time in 12 months. Broiler chickens are birds kept to produce meat for human consumption.</p>
  
  <p>You must:</p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>
      take samples to test for salmonella in the 3 weeks before slaughter, for birds slaughtered at less than 82 days old
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>take samples in the 6 weeks before slaughter, for birds slaughtered at more than 81 days old (or younger but organic)</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>take samples in the 6 weeks before slaughter if you farm organic broilers</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>take boot swab, dust or hand-held faecal swabs using the methods agreed across the UK</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>label samples and send to an approved UK laboratory</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>make sure the laboratory can test your samples within 4 days</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>allow official sampling at your premises if you are selected at random</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>keep salmonella test, movement and medicine records for at least 2 years</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>declare all salmonella test results for your flock on food chain information documents (FCI) (these must accompany birds to slaughter)</p>
    </li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>If a broiler flock tests positive for salmonella, you must:</p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>arrange for the affected birds to be slaughtered either by an abattoir that can heat treat the meat or by a plant that can dispose of them as animal by-products</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>clean and disinfect sheds</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>take samples from your next flock</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>have a licence to move equipment, animals or birds on or off your premises</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>only restock after you have negative test results</p>
    </li>
  </ul>
  
  <h3 id="why-you-must-test-for-salmonella">Why must you test for salmonella</h3>
  
  <p>It is part of the national control programme (NCP) to reduce salmonella in poultry. You are breaking the law and may be prosecuted if you do not follow the rules.</p>
  
  <h3 id="who-does-not-need-to-test">Who does not need to test</h3>
  
  <p>You do not need to test your flock if you:</p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>produce birds for private domestic use (the birds do not enter the market)</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>supply the consumer direct (such as through farm-gate sales or local retailers)</p>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3 id="register-places-where-you-keep-flocks">Register places where you keep flocks</h3>
  
  <p>You must <a href="https://www.gov.uk/poultry-registration">register each premises where you keep more than 50 birds</a> if you farm in England, Scotland or Wales or <a rel="external" href="https://www.daera-ni.gov.uk/publications/bird-registration-form">register on the Northern Ireland Poultry Register</a>.</p>
  
  <h3 id="ask-your-vet-or-laboratory-for-advice">Ask your vet or laboratory for advice</h3>
  
  <p>They can help you:</p>
  
  <ul>

  <h3 id="work-out-how-many-flocks-you-must-test">Work out how many flocks you must test</h3>
  
  <p>A flock is a group of birds that shares the same air space, shed or range. You must take samples from all the flocks at your premises.</p>
  
  <p>Decide if you have one flock or more. If you have only one flock for all chickens, a positive result and official disease controls could have a large financial impact on your business. 
  </p>

  
  <p>If you need help to work out how many flocks you have, ask:</p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/animal-and-plant-health-agency/about/access-and-opening">Animal and Plant Health Agency (APHA)</a> if you are in England, Scotland or Wales</p>

  <h2 id="when-to-take-samples">When to take samples</h2>
  
  <h3 id="test-flocks-going-for-human-consumption-before-slaughter">Test flocks going for human consumption before slaughter</h3>
  
  <p>All flocks being slaughtered for human consumption must be tested before slaughter.</p>
  
  <p>You must take samples:</p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>in the 3 weeks before slaughter, for birds slaughtered at less than 82 days old (unless they are organic broilers)</li>
    <li>in the 6 weeks before slaughter, for birds slaughtered at more than 81 days old (or are younger but organic)</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>If you farm organic broilers, you must collect samples in the 6 weeks before slaughter. This only applies if your broilers have organic certification from <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/organic-certification-list-of-uk-approved-organic-control-bodies">a UK approved organic control body</a>.</p>
  
  <p>You should collect samples and get the result in time to send it with the birds to slaughter.</p>
  
  <h3 id="avoid-taking-samples-after-giving-antibiotics">Avoid taking samples after giving antibiotics</h3>
  
  <p>Avoid taking samples during or shortly after giving antimicrobials (antibiotics) that affect salmonella. APHA or DAERA could consider your flock to be positive for salmonella if either:</p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>inspectors see from the flock medicine book that you have given relevant antibiotics that affect salmonella, in the 14 days before NCP testing</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>the laboratory suspects that there may be disinfectant or antibiotics affecting your samples</p>
    </li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>To find out when you can sample after giving antibiotics, ask:</p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>the vet who prescribed them</li>
    <li>
  <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/animal-and-plant-health-agency/about/access-and-opening">APHA</a> if you farm in England, Scotland or Wales</li>

  <h2 id="choose-your-sampling-method">Choose your sampling method</h2>
  
  <p>You must use one of these methods.</p>
  
  <ol class="steps">
  <li>
  <p>Take 2 pairs of boot swabs from each flock. Put the boot swabs in a sample pot or sealable bag to send to the laboratory.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
  <p>Take one pair of boot swabs and one dust swab or one 100 gram (g) dust sample. Package the <a href="##How%20to%20take%20a%20boot%20swab%20sample">boot swabs</a> and <a href="##How%20to%20take%20a%20dust%20sample">dust sample</a> separately.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
  <p>Take one or more hand-held faecal swabs with a total surface area of 900 square centimeters (sq cm). Only use <a href="##How%20to%20take%20hand-held%20faecal%20swabs">hand-held faecal swabs</a> if you cannot use boot swabs because the houses are too small and have fewer than 100 birds at the time of sampling.

  <h3 id="how-to-take-a-boot-swab-sample">How to take a boot swab sample</h3>
  
  <p>Follow these instructions to make sure your approved laboratory accepts your samples and you comply with the NCP.</p>
  
  <p>Take samples in the existing bedding (litter). Do not put new bedding down before sampling.</p>
  
  <h4 id="prepare-to-take-a-boot-swab-sample">Prepare to take a boot swab sample</h4>
  
  <p>Gather all the equipment you need before you go into the chicken house, to prevent contamination before, during and after sampling. You should take special care to avoid cross-contaminating if you keep other animals (especially pigs or cattle) on your premises.</p>
  
  <p>You should use:</p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>disposable plastic over-boots</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>2 pairs of boot swabs - these must be absorbent enough to soak up moisture (you can also use tubegauze ‘socks’ or pre-moistened commercial swabs)</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>tap water or bottled still water for moistening boot swabs - do not use sparkling water or water treated with antibacterial agents or acids</p>

  <p>To prevent disinfectant or sanitiser affecting your sample, you should:</p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>not use hand sanitiser on your plastic gloves</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>put on your plastic over-boots only after you have walked through any disinfectant boot dip present (if you wear plastic over-boots when you walk through disinfectant, you must put on another pair afterwards to protect the boot swabs from the disinfectant)</p>

    <li>
      <p>APHA or DAERA if the sample tests positive for salmonella (this may be termed a Zoonoses Order or a ZO2 notification by some laboratories)</p>

  </ul>
  
    
  <h2 id="if-your-samples-test-positive-for-regulated-strains-of-salmonella">If your samples test positive for regulated strains of salmonella</h2>
  
  <p>APHA or DAERA will assess positive tests for non-vaccine regulated Salmonella strains.</p>
  
  <p>Inform your vet of the positive result if you have not made arrangements with the testing laboratory for this to happen automatically.</p>
  
  <p>You or your veterinarian should contact<a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/animal-and-plant-health-agency/about/access-and-opening"> </a><a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/animal-and-plant-health-agency/about/access-and-opening">APHA</a> or<a rel="external" href="https://www.daera-ni.gov.uk/contact"> </a><a rel="external" href="https://www.daera-ni.gov.uk/contact">DAERA</a> if you have evidence suggesting that the result may have been an error, for example as a result of contamination of the original sample.</p>
  
  <p>If APHA or DAERA suspects the original result is a false positive, they will collect official confirmatory samples to confirm the presence of:</p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>Salmonella Enteritidis</li>
    <li>Salmonella Typhimurium (including monophasic Salmonella Typhimurium)</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>APHA or DAERA will also ask for 5 birds to be culled and will take their carcases and store their organs when they collect confirmatory samples. These may be used to test for the presence of antibiotics if the confirmatory test is negative.</p>
  
  <h3 id="positive-tests-for-salmonella-enteritidis-or-typhimurium">Positive tests for Salmonella Enteritidis or Typhimurium</h3>
  
  <p>If Salmonella Enteritidis or Salmonella Typhimurium (including monophasic Salmonella Typhimurium) is identified, APHA or DAERA will take samples from every other flock on your premises.</p>
  
  <p>If you have a positive test result for these types of Salmonella, you must arrange for the affected birds to be slaughtered:</p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>by an abattoir prepared to accept them (as the meat will need to be heat treated and not all processors will have a market for this meat)</li>
    <li>and disposed of as animal by-products at an appropriately approved plant (by rendering or incineration)</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>You must also clean and disinfect the positive shed.</p>
  
  <p>APHA or DAERA will also take samples from your next crop of birds. If these tests are positive for Salmonella Enteritidis or Salmonella Typhimurium, APHA or DAERA will place your premises under a movement restriction.</p>
  
  <p>This means that you must have a licence from APHA or DAERA to move equipment, animals or animal products on to, or off your premises. This includes sending the birds to slaughter.</p>
  
  <p>You will also have to clean and disinfect the restricted poultry sheds under official supervision each time you de-populate.</p>
  
  <p>Once you are under movement restrictions, you can only restock your restricted poultry houses after tests come back negative.</p>
  
  <p>Speak to your vet for advice on how to control salmonella.</p>
  
  <p>You will not have to pay for any samples or testing carried out by APHA or DAERA because of a positive test result.</p>

  <h2 id="official-sampling">Official sampling at your premises</h2>
  
  <p>Officials may take a routine official sample in the lifetime of the flock. Each year officials must sample a single flock on 10% of broiler holdings. If you have had a random official visit at a site, you will not get another one for at least 5 years.</p>
  
  <p>APHA or DAERA will collect these official samples.</p>
  
  <p>You will be charged for these visits. An official sample can replace an operator sample. Find out the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/salmonella-national-control-programmes-fees">official sampling fees for England, Scotland and Wales</a>. Contact <a rel="external" href="https://www.daera-ni.gov.uk/">DAERA</a> for details of fees in Northern Ireland.</p>
  
  <p>Officials from APHA or DAERA can also visit to take samples:</p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>if Salmonella Enteritidis or Salmonella Typhimurium has been detected in another flock or in a previous crop of flocks on your premises</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>from all the flocks on your premises if a positive test for Salmonella Enteritidis or Salmonella Typhimurium at the hatchery you use has been traced to one of your flocks</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>from flocks where there is no evidence of testing</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>in cases where the competent authority (APHA or DAERA) considers it appropriate</p>
    </li>

  <h3 id="keep-salmonella-test-records">Keep salmonella test records</h3>
  
  <p>Each time you take samples, you must record:</p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>date and time you took the sample</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>flock identification (this is the flock’s house name or number, and the month and year the flock moved into the house)</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>type of sample (such as boot swabs or dust sample)</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>age of the flock</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>date you plan to have the flock slaughtered</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>laboratory that tested the sample</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>test result</p>
    </li>
  </ul>
  
  <h3 id="keep-movement-records">Keep movement records</h3>
  
  <p>You need to record any movement of birds to or from your premises. For each movement, record the:</p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>date of movement</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>number of birds</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>age of the birds</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>house name or number, and the month and year the flock moved onto your premises</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>address that the birds moved from (including the building name or number)</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>address that the birds moved to (including the building name or number)</p>
    </li>
  </ul>
  
  <h3 id="keep-medication-records">Keep medication records</h3>
  
  <p>When you give medicines, record the:</p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>medicines used</p>
    </li>
  <li>dose rate</li>
  
  <li>start and end date of treatment</li>
  
  <li>route of administration</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h2 id="food-chain-information-fci-documents-for-abattoirs">Food chain information (FCI) documents for abattoirs</h2>
  
  <p>You must declare the:</p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>most recent NCP test result</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>date of sampling</p>
    </li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>If a positive salmonella result has been identified earlier in the flock’s life, then this information (and the date the sample was collected) must also be reported on the FCI. This applies whether or not it was a NCP sample. You must do this in the FCI documents you send to the abattoir for your flock.</p>
  
  <p>If you plan to market meat from your birds as fresh meat, you must declare if this flock had an earlier positive NCP test result. You must do this even if the most recent NCP test result was negative. You must declare all previous NCP Salmonella-positive results.</p>
  
  <p>The FCI is a legal requirement. Birds may not be slaughtered for human consumption without this information. If the birds are culled on the farm and are disposed of as animal by-products, you do not need to provide FCI.</p>
