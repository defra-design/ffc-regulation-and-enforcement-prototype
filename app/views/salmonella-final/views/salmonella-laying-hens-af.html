  <h2 id="legal-requirements">Legal requirements</h2>

  <p>You must test for salmonella if you keep 350 or more laying hens of the same species at any time in 12 months.</p>
  
  <p>You must:</p>

  <ul>
      <li>
          <p>take samples from chicks on the day they arrive from the hatchery</p></li>
      <li><p>test pullets before they move to the laying unit</p></li>
      <li>test adult hens every 15 weeks starting when they are 22 to 26 weeks old</p></li>
      </li>
      <li>label the samples and send to an approved UK laboratory</li>
      <li>not sell eggs as Class A if your flock tests positive</li>
      <li>
          <p>keep salmonella test results, hen movement and medicine records for at least 2 years</p>
      </li>
      <li>
          <p>tell the Animal and Plant Health Agency (APHA) or the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs (DAERA) when you expect 250 or more hens to arrive on your holding</p>
      </li>
      <li>allow APHA to take official samples once a year (and pay for these)</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h3 id="why-do-you-need-to-test">Why you must test for salmonella</h3>

  <p>It is part of the national control programme (NCP) to reduce salmonella in poultry. You are breaking the law and may be prosecuted if you do not follow the rules.</p>

  <h3 id="import-eggs-chicks">Importing hatching eggs or chicks</h3>
  <p>If you import hatching eggs or day old chicks from Europe, check they have been tested for salmonella.</p>

  <h2 id="before-you-can-test-for-salmonella">Before you test for salmonella</h2>

  <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Register places where you keep flocks</h3>
  <p>
      You must <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/poultry-including-game-birds-registration-rules-and-forms">register all premises where you keep flocks of 50 birds or more</a>.</p>
  
      <p>In Scotland you must also register your laying flocks with the <a href="https://www.ruralpayments.org/publicsite/futures/topics/inspections/all-inspections/egg-and-poultry-inspections/">Scottish Government Poultry Unit</a> for egg marketing reasons.</p>
      <p>In Northern Ireland you must register all poultry flocks on the <a href="https://www.daera-ni.gov.uk/publications/bird-registration-form">Northern Ireland Poultry Register</a>. This includes single backyard hens. The only exception is if it is a pet bird that lives in the ownerâ€™s house.</p>
   
      <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Ask your vet or laboratory for advice</h3>
  <p>They can help you: </p>

  <ul class="govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>find an <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/salmonella-in-poultry-testing-laboratories-in-the-uk">an approved UK laboratory</a> or <a rel="external" href="https://www.daera-ni.gov.uk/articles/salmonella">find a DAERA approved laboratory</a> if you are in Northern Ireland</li>
      <li>
      <p>create sampling plans</p></li> 
      <li>train staff to take the samples correctly</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>get the sampling kit you need
      </p>
    </li>
  </ul>
   <p>You can make use of other training schemes like <a href="https://www.liontrainingpassport.co.uk">Lion Training Passport</a>.</p>
   
   <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Work out how many flocks you have to sample</h3>
 
   <p>A flock is a group of birds that shares the same air space, shed or range. You must take samples from all the flocks at your premises.</p>
  
   <p>You need to decide how many flocks you keep, so you collect all the necessary samples. If your birds form one flock and have a positive sample, they will all be treated as belonging to a positive flock. 
   </p>
   <p>Deciding whether you have one or more flocks could affect how a positive result and official disease controls affect your business financially.</p>

   <p>If you need help to work out how many flocks you have, ask:</p>
  <ul class="govuk-list--bullet">
    <li><a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/animal-and-plant-health-agency/about/access-and-opening">APHA</a> in England, Scotland and Wales

<h2 id="take-samples">When to take samples from laying hens</h2>


  <h3 id="make-sure-you-do-not-collect-samples-after-giving-antibiotics">Avoid taking samples after
    giving antibiotics</h3>

<p>Avoid taking samples while, or shortly after, giving your laying hens antimicrobials (antibiotics) that affect salmonella.</p> 
<p>APHA or DAERA could consider your flock to be positive for salmonella if:</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        <p>inspectors see from the flock medicine book that you have given antibiotics that affect salmonella within
            14 days before NCP testing</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>the laboratory suspects that there may be disinfectant or antibiotics affecting your samples</p>
    </li>
</ul>

<p>To find out when you can sample after giving antibiotics, ask:</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        <p>the vet who prescribed them</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p><a href="">APHA</a> in England, Scotland and Wales</p>

</ul>

  <h3 id="collect-samples-from-chicks-on-the-day-they-arrive-from-the-hatchery">Collect samples from chicks on the day they arrive from the hatchery</h3>

  <p>You should test:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>the liners (chick papers) from boxes used to deliver the chicks - one box for every 500 chicks from each
        delivery (up to 10 boxes)</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>any chicks that are dead on arrival (up to 60 from each hatchery)</p>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3 id="collect-samples-from-pullets-2-weeks-before-you-move-them-to-the-laying-unit">Collect samples from pullets 2
    weeks before you move them to the laying unit</h3>

  <p>You should test:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>2 pairs of <a href="#how-to-take-boot-swab-samples">boot swabs</a> (fabric overshoes) for your floor-reared
        birds</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>60 grams (g) of a <a href="#how-to-take-composite-faecal-samples">composite faeces sample</a></p>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>Composite means the faeces are from many birds in the flock.</p>

    your adult egg-laying hens every 15 weeks during the laying period</h3>

  <p>If officials collect routine samples during the laying period, you do not need to test again for 15 weeks.</p>

  <p>You must start to take samples from adult laying hens in the layer unit or house when they are 22 to 26 weeks old.</p>

  <p>For barn or free-range flocks, you should test:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>2 pairs of <a href="#how-to-take-boot-swab-samples">boot swabs</a> when not part of a multi-tier system</p>

        </ul>
          <p>Depending on the test results, APHA or DAERA will decide if and when to lift the restrictions on your flock.</p>
          
          <h3>Official samples from other flocks on your premises</h3>
          <p>Once APHA or DAERA identifies at least one flock as positive, their officials will take samples from every other flock on your premises.</p>
          
          <p>Officials will also visit and sample when a new flock is placed in the house where the last flock had a positive test result. They will take this official control sample when the birds are between 22 and 26 weeks old.</p>
          
          <p>A government vet will also visit your premises to give advice on salmonella control. In Northern Ireland contact DAERA or your private vet for advice.</p>
          
          <p>You will not have to pay for:</p>
            <ul class="govuk-list--bullet">
          <li>official sampling of other flocks on your premises</li>
          <li>testing the new flock following its move to the house which officials identified as positive</li>

            </ul>
          <h3>Positive results from a rearing flock</h3>
          <p>If a sample from your rearing flock tests positive for a regulated salmonella, officials may visit your farm to confirm the result and offer advice.</p>
          
          <h3>Get advice on controlling other salmonella infections</h3>
          <p>If your flock tests positive for other types of salmonella, you can get advice on how to control the infection from:</p>
          <ul class="govuk-list--bullet">
          <li>your vet</li>

          <h2 id="official-sampling-at-your-premises">Official sampling at your premises</h2>
           
          <p>If you keep more than 1,000 birds on your premises, officials will take a routine official sample once a year. </p>
           
          <p>In England, Scotland and Wales, routine official samples may be taken by an:</p>
           
        <ul>
          <li>APHA official</li>
          <li>authorised vet</li> 
          <li>Independent Control Body (ICB) auditor (if your flock is in the Lion Code scheme)</li>
        </ul>
          
        <p>In Northern Ireland, an official from DAERA will take routine official samples.</p>
           
        <p>You will be charged for these visits. An official sample can replace an operator sample. </p>

        <h2 id="food-chain-information-fci-documents-for-abattoirs">Include test results in food chain information (FCI) documents for abattoirs</h2>

        <p>When you send your flock to an abattoir for slaughter for human consumption you must fill in a <a rel="external"
            href="https://www.food.gov.uk/business-guidance/food-chain-information">FCI declaration document</a>.</p>

        <p>In the FCI document, you must declare information such as:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>the most recent NCP test result</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>the date the sample was collected</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>other diagnoses</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>the use of medicines</p>
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>If it was a negative NCP result, you must also declare any previous positive salmonella test results with the
          sample collection dates. This includes results from tests not taken as part of the NCP programme.</p>

        <p>You do not need to provide FCI if you cull the birds on the farm and:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>dispose of them as animal by-products</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>sell your birds direct to customers</p>
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>If selling your birds to customers, you should register this with your local authority. If your flock tests
          positive for salmonella, they will advise you on what you need to do to protect the health of your customers.</p>

        <p>You will need a <a>slaughtererâ€™s licence</a> or employ a licenced slaughterer to slaughter birds on your farm.</p>
