  <h2 id="legal-requirements">Legal requirements</h2>
  
  <p>You must test for salmonella if you keep 250 or more breeding chickens at any time in a 12 month period.</p>
  
  <p>You must:</p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>get a vet to take samples if you export or sell to a business that exports chicks</li>
    <li>
      <p>take samples from chicks on the day they arrive from a hatchery</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>take samples from young birds at 4 weeks old and 2 weeks before they move to the laying unit</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>take samples from adult breeding flocks every 3 weeks during the laying period</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>label the samples and send to an approved UK laboratory</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>keep salmonella test results, chicken movement and medicine records for at least 2 years</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>tell Animal and Plant Health Agency (APHA), or Department for Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs (DAERA) in Northern Ireland, when you expect 250 or more birds to arrive on your holding</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>allow APHA or DAERA to take official samples once a year (and pay for these)</p>
    </li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>If you get a positive result for a regulated strain of salmonella, you must:</p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>keep the birds and their eggs on your premises</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>destroy the flock if instructed to do so</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>take samples every 2 weeks for 12 months </p>
    </li>
  </ul>
  
  <h3 id="why-must-you-test">Why you must test for salmonella</h3>
  
  <p>It is part of the national control programme (NCP) to reduce salmonella in poultry. You are breaking the law and may be prosecuted if you do not follow the rules.</p>
  
  <h3 id="import-hatching-eggs-or-day-old-chicks-from-europe">Importing hatching eggs or day old chicks from Europe</h3>
  
  <p>Check they have been tested for salmonella.</p>
  
  <h3 id="export-hatching-eggs-or-chicks">Exporting hatching eggs or chicks</h3>
  
  <p>A vet or an official must collect the samples if you:</p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>export hatching eggs</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>supply a hatchery that exports hatching eggs for laying purposes</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>supply a hatchery that exports day-old chicks or older birds for breeding purposes</p>
    </li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>They will decide the sampling programme and train the staff who take the samples. NCP tests will be required if you export.</p>
  
  <h3 id="when-you-do-not-need-to-test-for-salmonella">When you do not need to test for salmonella</h3>
  
  <p>A flock does not need testing if:</p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>you produce hatching eggs or day-old chicks for scientific or research purposes</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>your eggs are not for human consumption</p>

  <h3 id="register-places-where-you-keep-flocks-and-your-hatchery">Register places where you keep flocks and your hatchery</h3>
  
  <p>You must <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/poultry-including-game-birds-registration-rules-and-forms">register each place where you keep flocks of 50 birds or more</a>.</p>
  
  <p>If you keep fewer than 50 birds, you can choose to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/poultry-including-game-birds-registration-rules-and-forms">register on APHA’s GB Poultry Register</a>.</p>
  
  <p>In Northern Ireland you must <a href="https://www.daera-ni.gov.uk/publications/bird-registration-form">register all poultry flocks on the Northern Ireland Poultry Register</a>. This includes single backyard hens. The only exception is if it is a pet bird that lives in the owner’s house.</p>
  
  <p>You must:</p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>register your hatchery if it can incubate 1,000 eggs or more</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>state which species of poultry you will hatch</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>tell APHA or the NI Poultry Register if you change the species you hatch</p>
    </li>
  </ul>
  
  <h3 id="ask-your-vet-or-test-laboratory-for-advice">Ask your vet or test laboratory for advice</h3>
  
  <p>They can help you:</p>

  <h3 id="work-out-how-many-flocks-you-have-to-sample">Work out how many flocks you have to sample</h3>
  
  <p>A flock is a group of birds that shares the same shed or air space. You must take samples from all the flocks at your premises. </p>
   <p>The decision about whether you have one or more flocks could affect how official disease controls affect your business if sampling gives a positive result.</p>
   <p>If you need help to work out how many flocks you have, ask:</p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>

  <h3 id="avoid-taking-samples-after-giving-antibiotics-to-breeding-chickens">Avoid taking samples after giving antibiotics to breeding chickens</h3>
  
  <p>Avoid taking samples while, or shortly after, giving your breeding chickens antimicrobials (antibiotics) that affect salmonella. </p>
  <p>APHA or DAERA could consider your flock to be positive for salmonella if:</p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>inspectors see from the flock medicine book that you have given antibiotics that affect salmonella within 14 days before NCP testing - the laboratory suspects that there may be disinfectant or antibiotics affecting your samples</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>To find out when you can sample after giving antibiotics, ask:</p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>the vet who prescribed them</p>
    </li>
    <li>

  <h3 id="take-samples-from-chicks-on-the-day-they-arrive-from-a-hatchery">Take samples from chicks on the day they arrive from a hatchery</h3>
  
  <p>You must test:</p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>the liners (chick papers) from boxes used to deliver the chicks - one box for every 500 chicks from each delivery (up to 10 boxes)</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>any chicks that are dead on arrival (up to 60 from each hatchery)</p>

  <p>You must test:</p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>2 pairs of <a href="#take-boot-swab-samples">boot swabs</a> (fabric overshoes) for your floor-reared birds</p>

    <li>
      <p>60g of a <a href="#take-composite-faeces-samples">composite faeces sample</a></p>
    </li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>Composite means the faeces are from many birds in the flock.</p>
  
  <h3 id="take-samples-from-adult-breeding-flocks-every-3-weeks-during-the-laying-period">Take samples from adult breeding flocks every 3 weeks during the laying period</h3>
  
  <p>If officials collect routine samples during this period, you do not need to test again for 3 weeks.</p>
  
  <p>For floor-reared birds, you should test one of the following:</p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>5 pairs of <a href="#take-boot-swab-samples">boot swabs</a></p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>one pair of <a href="#take-boot-swab-samples">boot swabs</a> and <a href="#take-dust-samples">one dust sample</a></p>
    </li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>For cage-reared birds, you should test one of:</p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>2 <a href="#take-composite-faeces-samples">composite faeces samples</a> of 150g each</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>one <a href="#take-composite-faeces-samples">composite faeces sample</a> and one <a href="#how-to-take-dust-samples">dust sample</a></p>
    </li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>If your flock is housed in a cage or multi-tier system and you are unable to collect sufficient pooled faeces or boot swabs for the whole house, contact APHA or DAERA for sampling advice.</p>
  
  <h2 id="how-to-take-samples">How to take boot swab, dust, composite and fabric swab samples</h2>
  
  
  <h3 id="prepare-to-take-samples">Prepare to take samples</h3>
  
  <p>Gather all the equipment you need before you go into the poultry house, to prevent contamination while sampling. Take care to avoid cross-contamination if you keep other animals (especially other poultry, pigs or cattle).</p>
  
  <p>Take samples from the existing litter. Do not put new litter down in the 2 days before sampling.</p>
  
  <h3 id="how-to-take-boot-swab-samples">How to take boot swab samples</h3>
  
  <p>You will need:</p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>disposable plastic overboots - put these on only after you have walked through any disinfectant boot-dip</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>one or 5 pairs of boot swabs, depending on the sampling method</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>tap water or bottled still water for moistening boot swabs - do not use sparkling water or water treated with antibacterial agents or acids</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>disposable plastic gloves - do not use hand sanitiser as it could affect your sample</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>leak-proof sealable bags or sample pots</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>packaging for sending your sealable bags or sample pots to the laboratory</p>
    </li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>To take samples from each flock:</p>
  
  <ol class="steps">
  <li>
  <p>Moisten the boot swabs (if not using pre-moistened boot swabs) with tap water or bottled still water.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
  <p>For 5 pairs of boot swabs, divide the house into 5 equal parts for sampling and use one pair of boot swabs in each part. If only collecting one pair of boot swabs, use them to sample the whole house.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
  <p>Take at least 100 steps with each pair of boot swabs, walking round the entire area to be sampled.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
  <p>Drag your feet on the floor as you are walking, to pick up as much material as you can.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
  <p>If the house is divided into several pens, spend more time in the larger pens and less in the smaller pens to make sure every pen is included in the sampling.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
  <p>When you have finished sampling, take the boot swabs off and carefully turn them inside out so that the faeces you have collected stay on them.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
  <p>For 5 pairs of boot swabs, put 2 pairs of boot swabs together in one bag or container and 3 pairs together in another. You can also split the 5 boot swab pairs equally into 2 bags. If only collecting one pair of boot swabs, put them together in one bag or container.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
  <p>Label each container carefully, ready to send to the laboratory.</p>
  </li>
  </ol>
  
  <h3 id="take-dust-samples">How to take dust samples</h3>
  
  <p>Choose one of these methods:</p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>collect 100g of dust from multiple places in the house and put it in a pot</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>use one or more moistened fabric swabs with a total surface area of at least 900 square centimetres (sq cm)</p>
    </li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>If you use fabric swabs, you will need:</p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>one fabric swab</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>tap water or bottled still water for moistening fabric swabs which are not already pre-moistened - do not use sparkling water or water treated with antibacterial agents or acids</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>disposable plastic gloves - do not use hand sanitiser as it could affect your sample</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>leak-proof sealable bags or sample pots</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>packaging for sending your sealable bags or sample pots to the laboratory</p>
    </li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>To take dust samples:</p>
  
  <ol class="steps">
  <li>
  <p>Put on new disposable gloves.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
     <p>If not already pre-moistened, moisten the fabric swabs with the tap water or bottled still water.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
  <p>Coat both sides of the pre-moistened swabs with dust collected from multiple places in the house</p>
  </li>
  </ol>
  <p>Avoid collecting dust from feeding systems. Package dust swabs separately from your boot swabs.</p>
  
  <h3 id="take-composite-faeces-samples">How to take composite faeces samples</h3>
  
  <p>You will need:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>disposable plastic gloves - do not use hand sanitiser as it could affect your sample</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>inverted bags or spatula to collect the samples</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>4 fabric swabs with a surface area of at least 900 sq cm for cage houses where sufficient faeces does not collect on scrapers or belt cleaners</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>tap water or bottled still water for moistening fabric swabs - do not use sparkling water or water treated with antibacterial agents or acids</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>leak-proof sealable bags or sample pots for faeces or swabs</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>packaging for sending your sealable bags or sample pots to the laboratory</p>
    </li>
  </ul>
  
  <h4 id="take-composite-faeces-samples-from-dropping-belts-or-scrapers">Take composite faeces samples from dropping belts or scrapers</h4>
  
  <p>To get a representative and fresh sample you should:</p>
  
  <ol class="steps">
  <li>
  <p>Run belts or scrapers just before you take the samples.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
  <p>Collect faeces from scrapers at the discharge ends of the dropping belts on every row and tier of the cages.</p>
  </li>
  </ol>
  
  <p>If you do not collect enough faeces from scrapers or belt cleaners, swab over a large area at the discharge end of belts after they have been run.</p>
  
  <h4 id="take-composite-faeces-samples-without-dropping-belts-or-scrapers">Take composite faeces samples without dropping belts or scrapers</h4>
  
  <p>If there are no belts, you must collect samples from cages or across the area of the dropping pit. Make sure the material you collect is representative of the whole house.</p>
  
  <p>For sampling young birds:</p>
  
  <ol class="steps">
  <li>
  <p>Collect at least 60 individual samples of faeces that each weigh at least 1 gram (g).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
  <p>Send the whole sample (at least 60g of faeces) in a pot or sealable bag to the laboratory.</p>
  </li>
  </ol>
  
  <p>For sampling adult birds:</p>
  
  <ol class="steps">
  <li>
  <p>Collect faeces from the droppings pit - at least 20 pinches of fresh surface material from each row of faeces.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
  <p>Send 2 samples of at least 150g each in a pot or sealable bag to the laboratory (150g is about the amount that fits in a coffee mug).</p>
  </li>
  </ol>
  
  <h2 id="what-to-do-with-the-samples">What to do with the samples</h2>
  
  <h3 id="label-samples">Label samples and identify flock</h3>
  
  <p>On each label, you must include the:</p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>funique identifier of the specific flock</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>flock house name or number</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>month and year you moved the flock into that house</p>
    </li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>On the label or the laboratory’s submission form or system, include the:</p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>type(s) of sample taken</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>date you took the sample</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>registration number, County Parish Holding (CPH) number, or DAERA flock number</p>
    </li>

    </li>
  </ul>
  
  <h3 id="send-samples-to-a-uk-approved-laboratory">Send samples to a UK approved laboratory</h3>
  
  <p>You should send your samples on the day you collect them. If you do not send them within 24 hours, you must refrigerate them at 2 to 8°C. You must not freeze samples.</p>
  
  <p>Check that the laboratory can start testing your samples within 4 days of sampling.</p>
  
  <div class="call-to-action">
  <p>You will need to send more samples if your samples are delayed, or the laboratory cannot meet the testing deadline.</p>
  </div>
  
  <p>The laboratory will send your results to:</p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>the person who sent the sample or the registered owner of the sampled flock</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>APHA or DAERA - if the sample tests positive for salmonella (this may be referred to as a Zoonoses Order or a ZO2 notification by some laboratories)</p>
    </li>
  </ul>
  
  <h2 id="if-your-samples-test-positive-for-regulated-strains-of-salmonella">If your samples test positive for regulated strains of salmonella</h2>
  
  <p>Restrictions to your flocks and premises may apply and if so you will need to take actions.</p>
  
  <p>You will need to inform your vet of the positive result, if you have not made arrangements with the testing laboratory to do this automatically.</p>
  
  <p>If you suspect the result may have been due to an error (for example contamination of the original sample), you or your vet should contact APHA or DAERA. If APHA or DAERA agree, they will collect official confirmatory samples.</p>
  
  <p>If confirmatory testing is completed, APHA may ask you to cull 5 birds. They will take the carcases and store their organs when they collect confirmatory samples. They may use these to test for the presence of antibiotics if the confirmatory test is negative.</p>
  
  <h3 id="positive-tests-for-salmonella-enteritidis-or-typhimurium">Positive tests for Salmonella Enteritidis or Typhimurium</h3>
  
  <p>If APHA or DAERA confirm a non-vaccine strain of Salmonella Enteritidis or Salmonella Typhimurium (including monophasic Salmonella Typhimurium) in your flock, you must:</p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>keep the flock that tested positive and its eggs on the farm</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>slaughter the whole positive flock as soon you are told to do this</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>arrange the destruction of all incubating eggs placed in the hatchery since the infection was found in the flock, and possibly eggs laid for up to 6 weeks before collecting the positive sample</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>request a movement licence from APHA or DAERA if you want to move any unincubated eggs for heat treatment or disposal</p>
    </li>
  </ul>
  
  <h3 id="positive-tests-for-other-regulated-strains-salmonella-hadar-salmonella-infantis-or-salmonella-virchow">Positive tests for other regulated strains: Salmonella Hadar, Salmonella Infantis or Salmonella Virchow</h3>
  
  <p>If APHA or DAERA confirm other regulated strains, you must:</p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>make a control plan with your vet and APHA or DAERA</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>increase biosecurity measures to prevent the spread of salmonella</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>thoroughly clean and disinfect the affected house after flock depletion</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>take samples after thorough cleaning and disinfection</p>
    </li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>You can only move new birds into the house if test results on post-cleaning samples are negative.</p>
  
  <p>APHA or DAERA may check your hatchery to see if salmonella has become established there.</p>
  
  <h3 id="official-samples-from-other-flocks-on-your-premises">Official samples from other flocks on your premises</h3>
  
  <p>Once APHA or DAERA identifies at least one flock as positive for Salmonella Enteritidis or Typhimurium, they will:</p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>take samples from all the other flocks on you r premises free of charge</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>take samples when a new flock is placed in the house where the last positive test result occurred - free of charge for young birds not yet in production, routine official sample charges apply for adult laying birds</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>visit your premises to give advice on salmonella control</p>
    </li>
  </ul>
  
  <h3 id="ncp-samples-after-a-positive-result-for-a-regulated-salmonella">NCP samples after a positive result for a regulated salmonella</h3>
  
  <p>In Great Britain, you must take NCP samples every 2 weeks for 12 months after the identification of a positive result for any of the regulated strains. The 12 month period starts from when the house where the positive flock lived was disinfected.</p>
  
  <h3 id="compensation">Compensation</h3>
  
  <p>When a government organisation requires your birds to be culled, it will pay compensation for them as long as you follow its instructions.</p>
  
  <p>Compensation only applies if your flock tests positive for:</p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>Salmonella Enteritidis</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Salmonella Typhimurium</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>monophasic Salmonella Typhimurium</p>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2 id="official-sampling-at-your-premises">Official sampling at your premises</h2>
  
  <p>Officials will take a routine official sample twice in the lifetime of the flock, at the beginning and end of the lay period.</p>
  
  <p>If your flock tested positive for a regulated salmonella in the past year, officials will then take 3 routine official samples:</p>

  <p>You must tell APHA or DAERA 2 weeks before the date you expect every breeding flock of at least 250 birds to arrive at your holding.</p>
  
  <p>If you farm in England, Scotland and Wales, contact <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/animal-and-plant-health-agency/about/access-and-opening#customer-service-centres-csc="> >APHA Customer Service Centre: One Health Worcester</a>.</p>
  
  <p>If you farm in Northern Ireland, contact <a href="https://www.daera-ni.gov.uk/contact">DAERA</a>.</p>
  
  <p>Tell APHA or DAERA the:</p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>name, address and telephone number of the holding</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>name, address and telephone number of the occupier and the person who owns each breeding flock on the holding</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>numbers of flocks on the holding</p>
    </li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>For each flock, include:</p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>a way to identify the chicken breeding flock</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>the number of poultry</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>the status in the breeding pyramid of the flock</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>whether the flock are layer breeders or meat breeders</p>
    </li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>Layer breeder means poultry kept to produce eggs intended for the incubation and hatching of chicks:</p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>that will be grown to produce eggs for human consumption, or</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>whose chicks will be grown to produce eggs for human consumption.</p>
    </li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>Meat breeder means poultry kept to produce eggs intended for the incubation and hatching of chicks:</p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>that will be grown to produce meat for human consumption, or</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>whose chicks will be grown to produce meat for human consumption.</p>
    </li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>You must also tell APHA or DAERA at least 2 weeks before a breeding flock is expected to move to the laying phase or to a laying unit including the:</p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>date that the flock will move</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>likely end of production or de-population</p>
    </li>
  </ul>
  
  <h2 id="include-test-results-in-food-chain-information-fci-documents-for-abattoirs">Include test results in food chain information (FCI) documents for abattoirs</h2>
  
  <p>When you send your flock to an abattoir for slaughter for human consumption you must fill in a <a>FCI declaration document</a>.</p>
  
  <p>In the FCI document, you must declare:</p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>the most recent NCP test result</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>the date the sample was collected</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>other diagnoses</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>the use of medicines</p>
    </li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>If it was a negative NCP result, you must also declare any previous positive salmonella test results with the sample collection dates. This includes results from tests not taken as part of the NCP programme.</p>
  
  <p>You do not need to provide FCI if you cull the birds on the farm and:</p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>dispose of them as animal by-products</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>sell your birds direct to customers</p>
    </li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>If selling your birds to customers you should register this with your local authority. If your flock tests positive for salmonella, they will advise you on what you need to do to protect the health of your customers.</p>
  
  <p>You will need a <a>slaughterer’s licence</a> or employ a licenced slaughterer to slaughter birds on your farm.</p>
