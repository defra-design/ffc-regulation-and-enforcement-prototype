 <h2 id="planning-to-apply-organic-manure-and-manufactured-fertiliser" class="govuk-heading-m">Planning to apply organic manure and manufactured fertiliser</h2>

 <p class="govuk-body">Inspectors may:</p>

 <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li>check for soil test results</li>
  <li>check the dates of soil tests</li>
  <li>ask to see a nutrient management plan or a written document which shows the crops you grow, how you’ve worked out how much to apply and where you’ve applied nutrients</li>
  <li>expect to see evidence that you’ve used industry recognised guidance to work out how much to apply</li>
  <li>ask you to explain why you did not use a recognised nutrient management system (such as RBS209)</li>
  <li>compare farm fertiliser records with crop nutrient requirements</li>
  <li>check for pollution</li>
  <li>identify areas where there is a risk of pollution</li>
  <li>check machine maintenance records</li>

 <h2 id="storing-organic-manure" class="govuk-heading-m">Storing organic manure</h2>

 <p class="govuk-body">Inspectors may:</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
   <li>measure distances from stores to surface waters, springs, wells or boreholes</li>
   <li>check the area around stored organic manures for potential pathways where runoff could flow into inland freshwaters and coastal waters</li>
 </ul>

 <h2 id="spreading-organic-manure" class="govuk-heading-m">Spreading organic manure</h2>

 <p class="govuk-body">Inspectors may:</p>

 <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
   <li>want to know what has been spread and where</li>
   <li>check calibration records</li>
   <li>measure any buffer strips</li>
   <li>check distance from any spread material to water and look for signs of associated water pollution</li>
   <li>check for any signs of manures deposited onto the surface within restricted distances</li>
 </ul>

 <h2 id="applying-manufactured-fertiliser" class="govuk-heading-m">Applying manufactured fertiliser</h2>

 <p class="govuk-body">Inspectors may:</p>

 <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
   <li>check for obvious visual signs of fertiliser prills (pellets) or granules within 2m of fresh or coastal waters</li>
   <li>check for excessive growth of marginal vegetation - this may indicate fertiliser that has been spread too far</li>
   <li>test soil for nutrients in the 2m zone and the rest of the field if appropriate</li>
   <li>check fertiliser records and any notes you keep on calibrating equipment</li>
 </ul>

 <h2 id="taking-reasonable-precautions-to-prevent-soil-loss" class="govuk-heading-m">Taking reasonable precautions to prevent soil loss</h2>

 <p class="govuk-body">Inspectors may:</p>

 <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
   <li>check to see that you have taken reasonable precautions to prevent erosion and runoff over a single area of one or more hectares caused by land management and cultivation</li>
   <li>make sure that you have planted the correct crop for the conditions in the field</li>
 </ul>

 <p>If the inspector finds evidence of pollution, soil erosion or runoff from an area over one hectare, they will identify the source, pathway and receptor.</p>

 <h2 id="managing-livestock-to-prevent-soil-erosion" class="govuk-heading-m">Managing livestock to prevent soil erosion</h2>

 <p class="govuk-body">Inspectors may:</p>

 <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet" class="govuk-heading-m">
   <li>measure the distance of any livestock poaching identified along a continuous stretch of a watercourse to see if it exceeds 20 metres long and 2 metres wide</li>
   <li>check for any poaching and measure the distance from inland freshwater or coastal waters</li>
   <li>check to see that you’ve taken reasonable precautions to prevent erosion and runoff over a single area of 1 or more hectares as a result of livestock</li>
 </ul>

 <h2 id="positioning-livestock-feeders" class="govuk-heading-m">Positioning livestock feeders</h2>

 <p class="govuk-body">Inspectors may:</p>

 <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
   <li>measure the distance of livestock feeders from inland freshwater or coastal water</li>
   <li>check to see if livestock feeders pose a risk to water quality by being located in high risk areas that will act as a pathway</li>
 </ul>
