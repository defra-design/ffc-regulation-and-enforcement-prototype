<h2 id="legal-requirements" class="govuk-heading-m">Legal requirements</h2>

<p class="govuk-body">You must:</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li>plan your application of organic manures and manufactured fertilisers to cultivated land</li>
  <li>avoid causing significant risk of pollution</li>
  <li>test cultivated agricultural soil for phosphorous, potassium, magnesium, pH and nitrogen levels at least every 5 years — you can use the soil nitrogen supply calculator to work out nitrogen levels instead of a soil test</li>
  <li>use the results of these tests when you plan your applications to make sure you meet soil and crop nutrient needs</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="terms-explained">Terms explained</h3>

<p class="govuk-body">Organic manures are made from one or more animal, plant or human sources. They include farm yard manure that has been stored but not livestock droppings deposited directly onto land. They may be generated on the farm or come from off-farm sources.</p>

<p class="govuk-body">Manufactured fertilisers are inorganic and bagged fertilisers containing nitrogen.</p>

<p class="govuk-body">Applying includes:</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li>spreading on the surface of the land</li>
  <li>injecting into the soil</li>
  <li>mixing manure or fertiliser with the surface layers of soil</li>
</ul>

<p class="govuk-body">Cultivated agricultural land is both or one of the following:</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li>land you’ve ploughed, sowed or harvested at least once in the last year</li>
  <li>land where you’ve applied organic manure or fertiliser at least once in the last 3 years</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="best-practice-to-plan-your-use-of-organic-manure-and-fertiliser" class="govuk-heading-m">Best practice to plan your use of organic manure and fertiliser</h2>

<p>Have a <a href="https://defrafarming.blog.gov.uk/sustainable-farming-incentive-pilot-guidance-create-and-use-a-nutrient-management-plan/">nutrient management plan</a>. What you include in the plan is up to you. Use the plan to inform decisions about your use of organic manure and manufactured fertiliser to give your crops the nutrients they need.</p>

<h2 id="best-practice-to-show-youve-considered-the-risk-of-pollution">Best practice to show you’ve considered the risk of pollution</h2>

<p class="govuk-body">Create a farm map that identifies areas that could be at risk from runoff or soil erosion.</p>

<p class="govuk-body">Factors that could cause significant risk include:</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li>angle of slopes, in particular if the angle is greater than 12 degrees</li>
  <li>amount of ground cover</li>
  <li>distance to inland freshwaters, coastal waters, wetlands, springs, wells or boreholes</li>
  <li>soil type and condition</li>
  <li>presence and condition of land drains</li>
</ul>

<p class="govuk-body">Avoid loss of nutrients through runoff and incorporate applied organic manure and manufactured fertiliser into the soil within 12 hours or as soon as possible if you can. This does not apply to grassland.</p>

<h2 id="best-practise-to-work-out-soil-nutrient-and-crop-needs" class="govuk-heading-m">Best practise to work out soil nutrient and crop needs</h2>

<p class="govuk-body">You should:</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li>plan what nutrients you are going to spread on the land</li>
  <li>apply nutrients only in quantities that do not exceed the crop or soil need</li>
  <li>use the results of soil sampling and analysis or a soil nitrogen supply assessment to work out how much to apply</li>
</ul>

<p class="govuk-body">When deciding what nutrients your crops need, you should use one of these:</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li>a nutrient management guide, such as <a rel="external" href="https://ahdb.org.uk/nutrient-management-guide-rb209">RB209 from the Agriculture and Horticulture Development Board</a>
</li>
  <li>farm software such as <a rel="external" href="https://www.planet4farmers.co.uk/Content.aspx?name=PLANET">PLANET</a> or <a rel="external" href="http://www.planet4farmers.co.uk/Manner.aspx">MANNER-NPK</a>
</li>
  <li>nutrient management tools, such as those provided by <a rel="external" href="http://www.nutrientmanagement.org/what-we-do/tools/">Tried and Tested</a> including a <a rel="external" href="https://www.nutrientmanagement.org/what-we-do/calculators-and-estimators/">soil nitrogen supply calculator</a>
</li>
  <li>a suitably qualified professional, such as an agronomist or Fertiliser Advisers Certification and Training Scheme (FACTS) adviser</li>
</ul>

<p class="govuk-body">You can identify the nutrient content of organic manure using nutrient management tools or manure testing, such as laboratory analysis or near infra-red sensors for liquid manures.</p>

<p class="govuk-body">If your farm is in a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/nitrate-vulnerable-zones">Nitrate vulnerable zone</a> there are additional rules to follow.</p>
