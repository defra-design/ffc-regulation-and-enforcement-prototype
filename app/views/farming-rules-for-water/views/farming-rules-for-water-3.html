<h1 id="plan-before-you-apply-organic-manure-or-manufactured-fertiliser">Plan before you apply organic manure or manufactured fertiliser</h1>

<h2 id="legal-requirements">Legal requirements</h2>

<p>Plan your application of organic manures and manufactured fertilisers to cultivated land.</p>

<p>You must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>avoid causing significant risk <sup><a href="" id="cmnt_ref4">[d]</a></sup><sup><a href="" id="cmnt_ref5">[e]</a></sup><sup><a href="" id="cmnt_ref6">[f]</a></sup>of pollution</li>
  <li>test cultivated agricultural soil for phosphorous, potassium, magnesium, pH and nitrogen levels at least every 5 years — you can use the soil nitrogen supply calculator to work out nitrogen levels instead of a soil test</li>
  <li>use the results of these tests when you plan your applications to make sure you meet soil and crop nutrient needs</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="terms-explained">Terms explained</h3>

<p>Organic manures are made from one or more animal, plant or human sources. They include farm yard manure that has been stored but not livestock droppings deposited directly onto land. They may be generated on the farm or come from off-farm sources.</p>

<p>Manufactured fertilisers are inorganic and bagged fertilisers containing nitrogen.</p>

<p>Applying includes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>spreading on the surface of the land</li>
  <li>injecting into the soil</li>
  <li>mixing manure or fertiliser with the surface layers of soil</li>
</ul>

<p>Cultivated agricultural land is both or one of the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>land you’ve ploughed, sowed or harvested at least once in the last year</li>
  <li>land where you’ve applied organic manure or fertiliser at least once in the last 3 years</li>
</ul>

What you include in the plan is up to you. Use the plan to inform decisions about your use of organic manure and manufactured fertiliser to give your crops the nutrients they need.</h2>

<h3 id="best-practice-to-show-youve-considered-the-risk-of-pollution">Best practice to show you’ve considered the risk of pollution</h3>

<p>Create a farm map that identifies areas that could be at risk from runoff or soil erosion.</p>

<p>Factors that could cause significant risk include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>angle of slopes, in particular if the angle is greater than 12 degrees</li>
  <li>amount of ground cover</li>
  <li>distance to inland freshwaters, coastal waters, wetlands, springs, wells or boreholes</li>
  <li>soil type and condition</li>
  <li>presence and condition of land drains</li>
</ul>

<p>Avoid loss of nutrients through runoff and incorporate applied organic manure and manufactured fertiliser into the soil within 12 hours or as soon as possible if you can. This does not apply to grassland.</p>

<h2 id="best-practise-to-work-out-soil-nutrient-and-crop-needs">Best practise to work out soil nutrient and crop needs</h2>

<p>You should:</p>

<ul>
  <li>plan what nutrients you are going to spread on the land</li>
  <li>apply nutrients only in quantities that do not exceed the crop or soil need</li>
  <li>use the results of soil sampling and analysis or a soil nitrogen supply assessment to work out how much to apply</li>
</ul>

<p>When deciding what nutrients your crops need, you should use one of these:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a nutrient management guide, such as <a rel="external" href="https://ahdb.org.uk/nutrient-management-guide-rb209">RB209 from the Agriculture and Horticulture Development Board</a>
</li>
  <li>farm software such as <a rel="external" href="https://www.planet4farmers.co.uk/Content.aspx?name=PLANET">PLANET</a> or <a rel="external" href="http://www.planet4farmers.co.uk/Manner.aspx">MANNER-NPK</a>
</li>
  <li>nutrient management tools, such as those provided by <a rel="external" href="http://www.nutrientmanagement.org/what-we-do/tools/">Tried and Tested</a> including a <a rel="external" href="https://www.nutrientmanagement.org/what-we-do/calculators-and-estimators/">soil nitrogen supply calculator</a>
</li>
  <li>a suitably qualified professional, such as an agronomist or Fertiliser Advisers Certification and Training Scheme (FACTS) adviser</li>
</ul>

<p>You can identify the nutrient content of organic manure using nutrient management tools or manure testing, such as laboratory analysis or near infra-red sensors for liquid manures.</p>

<h2 id="other-related-legislation">
Other related legislation</h2>

<p>If your farm is in a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/nitrate-vulnerable-zones">Nitrate vulnerable zone</a> there are additional rules to follow.<sup><a href="" id="cmnt_ref7">[g]</a></sup></p>

<h2 id="take-reasonable-precautions-to-prevent-diffuse-pollution-1">Take reasonable precautions to prevent diffuse pollution</h2>

<h2 id="legal-requirements-4">Legal requirements</h2>
<p><sup><a href="" id="cmnt_ref8">[h]</a></sup>
##</p>

<p>You must take reasonable precautions to prevent agricultural diffuse pollution from your land management and cultivation practices.</p>

<p>These types of practices include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>creating farm tracks or gateways</li>
  <li>establishing seedbeds, polytunnels or tramlines</li>
  <li>cleaning out ditches</li>
  <li>installing drainage or irrigation</li>
  <li>irrigating crops or spraying them with pesticides, herbicides or fungicides</li>
</ul>

<p>Agricultural diffuse pollution is the transport of agricultural pollutants into inland or coastal waters. It can be transported by soil erosion or leaching and the pollutants may be harmful to human health or ecosystems.</p>

<p>Soil erosion is soil loss caused by soil runoff or degradation over a single area of agricultural land.</p>

<h2 id="best-practice-to-avoid-diffuse-pollution-from-farms">Best practice to avoid diffuse pollution from farms</h2>

<p>Reasonable precautions include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>only do activities when conditions are suitable and in such a way that does not risk causing significant pollution</li>
  <li>plant crops in early autumn and in dry conditions</li>
  <li>undersow or sow a cover crop to stabilise soil after harvest - a cover crop is any crop with leaf cover that stops rain falling directly onto the soil</li>
  <li>establish seedbeds, polytunnels or tramlines across the slope or with headland rows or beds across the base of sloping land</li>
  <li>break up compacted soil</li>
  <li>locate farm tracks or gateways where they pose as little risk of soil erosion into water as possible</li>
</ul>

<p>Measures to reduce pollution risk if soil erosion does occur include establishing:</p>

<ul>
  <li>grass buffer strips in valleys, along contours, slopes, field edges and gateways</li>
  <li>drainage ditches and sediment traps</li>
</ul>

<p>On your farm map record:</p>

<ul>
  <li>what you’ve done to help reduce the risk of soil loss or water pollution from your activities</li>
  <li>where these measures are</li>
</ul>

<p>====================================================================</p>

<h2 id="manage-livestock-and-feeders-to-prevent-soil-erosion">Manage livestock and feeders to prevent soil erosion</h2>

<p>Rules to prevent livestock from causing diffuse pollution and soil erosion on your farm.</p>

<h2 id="legal-requirements-5">Legal requirements</h2>

<p>You must not place livestock feeders:</p>

<ul>
  <li>within 10m of inland freshwaters or coastal waters</li>
  <li>within 50m of a spring, well or borehole</li>
  <li>where risk factors like slope, soil conditions or nearby water sources or land drains mean there’s a significant risk of pollution</li>
</ul>

<p>You must prevent livestock from eroding soil by trampling it (poaching) within 5m of inland freshwater or coastal water.</p>

<p>You must take reasonable precautions to prevent diffuse pollution as a result of livestock activities.</p>

<p>Best practice when you choose locations for livestock feeders
Record</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <h2 id="where-you-place-livestock-feeders-on-a-farm-map-or-plan">where you place livestock feeders on a farm map or plan.</h2>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="best-practice-to-prevent-livestock-causing-soil-loss">Best practice to prevent livestock causing soil loss</h3>

<p>Move livestock regularly to prevent soil loss and pollution from poaching.</p>

<p>Take reasonable precautions to prevent erosion and runoff over a single area of one or more hectares as a result of livestock. You should:</p>

<ul>
  <li>monitor the impact of livestock on your fields</li>
  <li>move livestock regularly or if there’s evidence of soil loss or pollution from poaching next to inland or coastal waters</li>
  <li>avoid poaching over a single stretch of agricultural land of at least 2 metres wide and 20 metres long</li>
  <li>erect fencing around inland freshwaters or coastal waters</li>
  <li>winter livestock on well-drained, level fields</li>
</ul>

<p>Record any precautions you’ve taken to reduce the risk of compacting soil.</p>
