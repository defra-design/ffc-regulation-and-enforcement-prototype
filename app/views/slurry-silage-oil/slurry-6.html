<p class="govuk-body">Slurry is defined by the Water Resources (Control of Pollution) (Silage, Slurry and Agricultural Fuel Oil) (England) Regulations 2010 (<a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/storing-silage-slurry-and-agricultural-fuel-oil" class="govuk-link">SSAFO</a>) as: “liquid or semi-liquid matter composed of excreta produced by livestock while in a yard or building (including that held in wood chip corrals); or a mixture wholly or mainly consisting of livestock excreta, livestock bedding, rainwater and washings from a building or yard used by livestock, of a consistency that allows it to be pumped or discharged by gravity at any stage in the handling process”.</p>

<p class="govuk-body">In the past, other terms were used to describe slurry of varying strengths or dilutions, such as dirty water and lightly fouled water. These are both forms of slurry.</p>

<h2 class="govuk-heading-m" id="rules-you-must-follow-if-you-store-slurry-including-in-earth-banked-stores">Rules you must follow if you store slurry, including in earth-banked stores</h2>

<p class="govuk-body">The rules are set out in the Water Resources (Control of Pollution) (Silage, Slurry and Agricultural Fuel Oil) (England) Regulations – known as the <a rel="external" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2010/639/contents/made" class="govuk-link">SSAFO regulations</a>.</p>

<p class="govuk-body">You must:</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li>tell the Environment Agency at least 14 days in advance of starting construction of a store</li>
  <li>not pollute the surrounding environment for example rivers or other watercourses</li>
  <li>collect and store slurry</li>

<h2 class="govuk-heading-m" id="building-new-or-making-substantial-changes-to-existing-slurry-storage">Building new or making substantial changes to existing slurry storage</h2>

<p class="govuk-body">Substantial changes usually means structural alterations, rather than minor repairs. Check with the Environment Agency if you’re not sure - they can also help you avoid committing an offence.</p>

<p class="govuk-body">New or substantially changed slurry storage tanks, effluent tanks, channels or reception pits must:</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li>last and be compliant with the SSAFO regulations for at least 20 years with maintenance</li>
  <li>be at least from 50m a spring, well or borehole</li>
  <li>be at least 10m from inland or coastal waters, including yard drains, dry ditches and land drains</li>

<p class="govuk-body">There are additional rules if you farm in a landscape where water supply is taken from groundwater. <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/groundwater-source-protection-zones-spzs" class="govuk-link">Groundwater source protection zones</a>  treat slurry and slurry effluent as organic manure.</p>

<p class="govuk-body">Contact the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/environment-agency#org-contacts" class="govuk-link">Environment Agency</a> to discuss how you can reduce risk in these areas.</p>

<p class="govuk-body">Before you build new storage, you must:</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li>check if you need planning permission</li>
  <li>make sure your planned structures meet these regulations about building new and substantially enlarged or reconstructed storage</li>
  <li>make sure it’s located at least 10m from inland or coastal waters</li>
  <li>make sure it has the storage capacity to meet the legal requirements</li>
  <li>make sure it meets <a rel="external" href="https://www.ciria.org/ItemDetail?iProductCode=C759F&amp;Category=FREEPUBS" class="govuk-link">building standards</a>
</li>
</ul>

<h3 class="govuk-heading-s" id="when-building-any-slurry-store">When building any slurry store</h3>

<p class="govuk-body">Slurry tanks, reception pits, pipes and channels must be impermeable and meet the anti-corrosion standards set in <a rel="external" href="http://shop.bsigroup.com/ProductDetail/?pid=000000000030219423" class="govuk-link">British Standard 5502-50:1993+A2:2010</a>. They should last for at least 20 years with maintenance.</p>

<p class="govuk-body">The base and walls of your slurry tank and any reception pit must withstand the wall loadings set in the <a rel="external" href="http://shop.bsigroup.com/ProductDetail/?pid=000000000030219423" class="govuk-link">standard</a>.</p>

<p class="govuk-body">You’re responsible for making sure your storage and maintenance complies with the rules – get advice from the Environment Agency, a suitably experienced consultant or engineer if you need it.</p>

<p class="govuk-body">You should get written confirmation from your supplier that the system meets these standards.</p>

<h3 id="minimum-capacity-for-slurry-stores">Minimum capacity for slurry stores</h3>

<p class="govuk-body">Freeboard is the vertical distance between the crest of your tank or lagoon and the slurry surface.</p>

<p class="govuk-body">When you calculate the required capacity of your steel or concrete store you’ll need to include a minimum of 300 millimetres (mm) of freeboard. For earth-banked stores you’ll need a minimum of 750mm and you must maintain this freeboard during use.</p>

<p class="govuk-body">You must have capacity for at least 4 months’ slurry storage – this depends on how much slurry you use, the size of your tanks and likely quantities of rainfall. If your farm is in the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/storing-organic-manures-in-nitrate-vulnerable-zones" class="govuk-link">nitrate vulnerable zone</a> you must have 5 or 6 months’ storage.</p>

<p class="govuk-body">You can use the <a rel="external" href="https://ahdb.org.uk/knowledge-library/slurry-wizard" class="govuk-link">AHDB Slurry Wizard</a> to work out how much slurry storage you need so that you comply with the regulations.</p>

<p class="govuk-body">Any temporary storage facilities you have – such as a reception pit — must be large enough to store a minimum of 2 days’ combined slurry production and likely rainfall.</p>

<h3 class="govuk-heading-s" id="drainage-pipes">Drainage pipes</h3>

<p class="govuk-body">Slurry tanks, effluent tanks or reception pits fitted with a drainage pipe must have 2 valves separated by at least 1m. Each valve must be able to shut off the flow of slurry and be locked when it’s not in use.</p>

<h3 class="govuk-heading-s" id="earth-banked-slurry-stores">Earth-banked slurry stores</h3>

<p class="govuk-body">Earth-banked stores must have impermeable soil with at least 1m thickness. You may need laboratory analysis and confirmation from a civil engineer to be sure your soil is suitable. Alternatively, you can import impermeable soil or use a synthetic liner.</p>

<p class="govuk-body">The permeability of your compacted soil must be less than 1 x 10-9 metres per second (0.000001 mm per second). Testing should be to <a rel="external" href="http://shop.bsigroup.com/ProductDetail?pid=000000000000227786" class="govuk-link">BS 1377-6:1990</a> or to <a rel="external" href="http://shop.bsigroup.com/ProductDetail/?pid=000000000030229304" class="govuk-link">BS EN 1997-2:2007</a>.</p>

<h3 class="govuk-heading-s" id="weeping-wall-stores">Weeping-wall stores</h3>

<p class="govuk-body">The base of a weeping-wall store must extend beyond its walls and include perimeter drains to catch escaped slurry and drain into an effluent tank.</p>

<h3 class="govuk-heading-s" id="once-youve-built-your-storage">Once you’ve built your storage</h3>

<p class="govuk-body">You must carry out maintenance to make sure there’s no risk of pollution.</p>

<h2 class="govuk-heading-m" id="storage-which-is-exempt-from-building-rules">Storage which is exempt from building rules</h2>

<p class="govuk-body">Your installation is exempt from the rules for new stores if you:</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li>built it before March 1991</li>
  <li>entered into a contract for construction before March 1991 and completed before September 1991</li>
</ul>

<p class="govuk-body">However, it is no longer exempt if you make substantial changes — for example structural changes, increasing capacity or relocating your store.</p>

<h3 class="govuk-heading-s" id="temporary-storage">Temporary storage</h3>

<p class="govuk-body">The rules do not apply to slurry you store temporarily in a tanker for transportation on roads or on a farm.</p>

<h2 class="govuk-heading-m" id="tell-the-environment-agency-about-your-planned-new-or-changed-storage">Tell the Environment Agency about your planned new or changed storage</h2>

<p class="govuk-body">You must contact the <a rel="external" href="https://wwww.gov.uk/government/organisations/environment-agency#org-contacts" class="govuk-link">Environment Agency</a> at least 14 days before you build new storage for slurry or make substantial changes to an existing store. You should tell them about your planned new or changed storage as early in the planning process as possible. You can also contact them for <a rel="external" href="https://wwww.gov.uk/government/organisations/environment-agency#org-contacts" class="govuk-link">advice on planning and building a store</a>.</p>
