  <p class="govuk-body">If the Environment Agency believes there’s a significant risk of pollution they can serve a notice at any time requiring you to bring storage up to the current standards.</p>

<p class="govuk-body">They can ‘serve a notice’ to stop you using an unsuitable slurry, silage or agricultural fuel oil store until you have improved or moved it. They’ll do this if they think there’s a significant risk of pollution – for example if you’ve not allowed enough capacity to store agricultural fuel oil.</p>

<p class="govuk-body">You’ll have at least 28 days to carry out the work. You may be allowed more time, for example if you need planning permission or the weather is unsuitable.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-appeal-a-notice" class="govuk-heading-m">How to appeal a notice</h2>
