<h2 id="legal-requirements" class="govuk-heading-m">Legal requirements</h2>

<p>Farmers and land managers who spread manufactured (inorganic, bagged) nitrogen fertilisers on land in an NVZ must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>plan how much nitrogen fertiliser to use</li>
  <li>assess risk of pollution from runoff</li>
  <li>where you can not spread manufactured fertilisers</li>
  <li>when you can not apply manufactured fertilisers</li>
  <li>keep records of fertiliser use for at least 5 years</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="nitrate-vulnerable-zones">Find out if your land is in an NVZ</a></p>

<h2 id="plan-your-nitrogen-use">Plan your nitrogen use</h2>

<p>You must plan all your applications of nitrogen on each crop in each field (including grass). This is your fertilisation plan. You must keep it as part of your farm records.</p>

<p>To help with your plan, you can use farm software like <a rel="external" href="http://www.planet4farmers.co.uk/Content.aspx?name=PLANET">PLANET</a> or tools like the <a rel="external" href="http://www.nutrientmanagement.org/what-we-do/tools/">‘Tried and Tested’</a> nutrient management tools.</p>

<p>Before you apply nitrogen fertiliser for the first time in a field where you’re going to plant a crop or have planted a crop, you must:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Calculate the amount of nitrogen in the soil that’s likely to be available for the crop to use during the growing season.</li>
  <li>Calculate the optimum amount of nitrogen that should be applied to the crop, taking into account the amount of nitrogen already available in the soil.</li>
  <li>Calculate the amount of nitrogen from any planned applications of organic manure that’s likely to be available to the crop in the growing season in which you spread it.</li>
  <li>Calculate the amount of manufactured nitrogen fertiliser you need.</li>
</ol>

<p>Your plan needs to show that you have calculated the nitrogen available in the soil for crop use and how much should be applied to the crop.</p>

<p>You must carry out steps 3 and 4 every time you apply nitrogen fertiliser or manure.</p>

<p>In subsequent growing seasons, before you apply nitrogen to any crop or land where you’re going to plant a crop (including grass) you must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>repeat steps 1 and 2</li>
  <li>prepare a plan for your fertiliser use for that growing season</li>
</ul>

<p>For permanent grassland, make your calculations based on the farming year starting on 1 January. Prepare a plan for any manure or fertiliser use for the year after that date.</p>

<h2 id="assess-the-risk-of-runoff-before-spreading">Assess the risk of runoff before spreading</h2>

<p>It’s an offence to allow fertiliser or organic manure to enter surface water (such as rivers or ponds).</p>

<p>You must inspect the field to assess the risk of nitrogen getting into surface water (for example, through runoff) before you spread any fertilisers or organic manures.</p>

<p>In particular, when assessing the risk of runoff, you need to take account of:</p>

<ul>
  <li>land that’s sloping, especially if the slope is over 12 degrees</li>
  <li>ground cover provided by vegetation</li>
  <li>the distance to surface water</li>
  <li>weather conditions</li>
  <li>the soil type and condition</li>
  <li>the presence of land drains</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="where-you-can-not-spread-manufactured-fertilisers">Where you can not spread manufactured fertilisers</h2>

<p>You must not spread any manufactured fertilisers if a field is either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>waterlogged, flooded or covered in snow</li>
  <li>frozen for more than 12 hours in the previous 24 hours</li>
</ul>

<p>You must not spread manufactured nitrogen fertiliser:</p>

<ul>
  <li>within 2 metres of surface water</li>
  <li>within a 2 metre zone from the centre of an established hedge</li>
</ul>

<p>You must only spread manufactured nitrogen fertilisers on agricultural land that you’re using to grow crops (including grass).</p>

<p>You must spread manufactured nitrogen fertilisers as accurately as possible.</p>

<h2 id="when-you-must-not-spread-manufactured-fertilisers">When you must not spread manufactured fertilisers</h2>

<p>For grassland the closed period is from 15 September to 15 January.</p>

<p>For tillage land the closed period is from 1 September to 15 January.</p>

<h3 id="for-certain-crops-you-can-spread-manufactured-fertilisers-during-the-closed-period">For certain crops you can spread manufactured fertilisers during the closed period</h3>

<p>You can spread manufactured nitrogen fertiliser during the closed period if you grow the crops listed and you keep to the limits and times shown.</p>

<p>If you grow crops that aren’t listed in the table, you must have written advice from a FACTS-qualified adviser before you spread manufactured nitrogen fertilisers.</p>
