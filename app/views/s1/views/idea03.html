        <p>Avoid taking samples while, or shortly after, giving your laying hens antimicrobials (antibiotics) that affect salmonella. APHA or DAERA could consider your flock to be positive for salmonella if:</p>
        
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>inspectors see from the flock medicine book that you’ve given antibiotics that affect salmonella within 14 days before NCP testing</p>
          </li>
          <li>

          </li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>To find out when you can sample after giving antibiotics, ask:</p>
        
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>the vet who prescribed them</p>

        </li>
        <li>
        <p>Take at least 100 steps with each pair of boot swabs, walking round the entire area to be sampled.</p>

        </li>
        <li>
        <p>When you’ve finished sampling, take the boot swabs off and carefully turn them inside out so that the faeces you’ve collected stay on them.</p>

        <p>You will need to inform your vet of the positive result, if the testing laboratory does not do this.</p>
        
        <p>In England, Scotland and Wales, if you suspect the result may have been due to an error (for example contamination of the original sample), you or your vet should contact APHA. If APHA agrees, they will collect official confirmatory samples.</p>
        
        <p>As part of this confirmatory sample, APHA may ask you to cull 5 birds. They’ll take the carcases and store their organs to test for the presence of antibiotics if the confirmatory test is negative.</p>

        <p>If APHA or DAERA confirm a non-vaccine strain of Salmonella Enteritidis or Salmonella Typhimurium (including monophasic Salmonella Typhimurium) in your flock, you must not sell your eggs from the positive flock as Class A.</p>
        
        <p>The flock will be put under a legal restriction which will prohibit the sale of their eggs as Class A eggs. If official confirmatory sampling on your flock does not confirm the initial positive result, then you can resume selling the flock’s eggs as Class A.</p>
        
        <p>If you want to sell your eggs as Class B, you must mark them:</p>
        
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>with the official Class B mark (a circle with the letter B inside)</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>using a spray or food dye to leave an easily visible coloured mark at least 5 millimetres (mm) in diameter</p>
          </li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>Before you can sell any eggs, local egg marketing inspectors or poultry unit officials will visit your premises to check you’re complying with these restrictions. They can advise further on the egg marking requirements.</p>

        <p>You may want to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/salmonella-national-control-programmes-fees">request more tests at your own cost</a> if you think a positive test result in an adult laying flock is false. You must do this operator optional testing within 4 weeks of the APHA or Agri-Food and Biosciences Institute (AFBI) laboratory reporting the positive sample. To find out about this type of retesting or arrange to get these tests contact:</p>

          </li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>APHA or DAERA will arrange for an official to supervise as you collect and test samples. You can choose what to sample from:</p>
        
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>300 hen carcasses (check that the laboratory can handle the samples)</p>

          <li>
            <p>4,000 eggs (check that the laboratory can handle the samples)</p>

            <p>appropriate environmental sampling to suit your flock’s management ( for example cage, free-range)</p>
          </li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>The official may also ask you to cull 5 birds. They’ll take the carcases and store their organs so that these can be tested for the presence of antibiotics if the optional test is negative.</p>
        
        <p>You can only get restrictions lifted, and sell eggs from the flock as Class A if the samples test negative for a regulated salmonella.</p>
        
        <h3 id="test-positive-and-we-take-official-samples-from-other-flocks-on-your-premises">Test positive and we take official samples from other flocks on your premises</h3>
        
        <p>Once APHA or DAERA identifies at least one flock as positive for Salmonella Enteritidis or Typhimurium, their officials will:</p>
        
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>take samples from every other flock on your premises - free of charge</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>take samples when a new flock is placed in the house where the last positive test result occurred - free of charge for young birds not yet in production, routine official sample charges apply for adult laying birds</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>visit your premises to give advice on salmonella control</p>
          </li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>If the positive result is from a rearing flock, your vet will decide how best to manage the risk of transferring infection to a laying site. There will also be restrictions on the flock.</p>
